"""Regression tests for Issue #802: File-based bypass for agent completeness gate.

The env var SKIP_AGENT_COMPLETENESS_GATE=1 is unreachable from Bash commands
because the hook runs in a separate process. This tests the file-based bypass
at /tmp/skip_agent_completeness_gate which IS reachable via:
  touch /tmp/skip_agent_completeness_gate && git commit ...

Issues: #802
