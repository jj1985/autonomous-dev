"""
Regression tests for Issue #310: Anti-stubbing enforcement.

Bug: Model replaces broken code with `raise NotImplementedError()` and declares
the feature "implemented". Same root cause as #206 — path of least resistance.

Fix: HARD GATE "No Stubs, No Shortcuts" in implementer.md with FORBIDDEN list,
and matching HARD GATE in implement.md STEP 8.

These tests verify the fix infrastructure exists and would break if removed.
