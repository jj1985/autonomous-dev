"""
Regression tests for Issue #206: Test gate bypass.

Bug: Model sees failing tests (e.g., "45/56 passing, 80%"), declares it a
"solid foundation", and skips to STEP 6 (validation) without fixing failures.

Fix: HARD GATE language in implement.md STEP 5 with explicit FORBIDDEN behaviors
and three allowed resolutions (fix, skip, adjust).

These tests verify the fix infrastructure exists and would break if removed.
