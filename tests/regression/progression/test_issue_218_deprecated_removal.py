Progression Tests for Issue #218: Remove deprecated batch_state_manager functions

TDD RED PHASE: These tests MUST FAIL initially (deprecated items still exist).

Goal: Verify that deprecated context clearing functions are removed from
batch_state_manager.py since Claude Code manages context automatically.

Deprecated Items to Remove:
- should_clear_context() function
- pause_batch_for_clear() function
- get_clear_notification_message() function
- @deprecated decorator
- CONTEXT_THRESHOLD constant

Test Categories:
1. Function Removal - Verify deprecated functions don't exist
2. Decorator Removal - Verify @deprecated decorator is removed
3. Constant Removal - Verify CONTEXT_THRESHOLD is removed
4. Core Functionality - Verify BatchState still works without deprecated functions
5. Backward Compatibility - Verify state file format compatibility
6. Documentation - Verify CHANGELOG documents breaking change

Created: 2026-01-09
