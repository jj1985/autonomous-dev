"""Regression test for Issue #852: doc-master completion events missing.

11/14 doc-master invocations had no completion events recorded because
SubagentStop doesn't fire reliably for background agents. The coordinator
called record_doc_verdict() but NOT record_agent_completion() for 'doc-master'.

Fix: Add explicit record_agent_completion('doc-master', ...) calls alongside
record_doc_verdict() in implement.md, implement-batch.md.

This test file verifies:
1. Pre-fix gap: record_doc_verdict alone does NOT add 'doc-master' to completions.
2. Post-fix behavior: calling both functions adds both entries correctly.
3. Idempotency: duplicate record_agent_completion calls don't corrupt state.
4. Static verification: command files contain both calls in proximity.
