"""Spec validation tests for Issue #880: objective scoring rubric in plan-critic agent.

Validates acceptance criteria:
1. Scoring rubric section with 5 levels defined for each axis
2. Scores table in each verdict template (PROCEED, REVISE, BLOCKED)
3. Verdict-score thresholds: PROCEED >= 3.0 (no axis <2), REVISE <3.0, BLOCKED <2.0
4. Delta tracking instruction for round 2+
5. Budget mode composite note
6. All existing content preserved (no deletions)
