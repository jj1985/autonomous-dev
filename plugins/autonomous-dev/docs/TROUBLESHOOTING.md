## Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Commands not appearing | Run `/reload-plugins` to reload commands/agents/skills. If hooks or settings changed, do a full restart (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q) instead |
| ModuleNotFoundError in hooks | Re-run `install.sh` or copy libs to `~/.claude/lib/` (see below) |
| ModuleNotFoundError in commands | Commands auto-resolve libs via multi-candidate resolver (`.claude/lib` → `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib` → `~/.claude/lib`) — re-run `install.sh` if libs are missing |
| Hook not running | Check `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| Context exceeded | Run `/clear` |
| Plugin changes not visible | Run `/sync --plugin-dev` then `/reload-plugins` (or full restart if hooks/settings changed) |
| Pipeline stuck mid-run (auto-compact, crash) | Run `/implement --resume <run_id>` — run_id is printed at STEP 0 |
| "Agent completeness gate BLOCKED" | Don't bypass. Run the missing agents. If this is a known false positive, escape hatch: `export SKIP_AGENT_COMPLETENESS_GATE=1` (audit-logged) |
| "Ordering violation: X requires Y" | The hook enforces pipeline sequence. Run the prerequisite agent first, or if it already ran, the session-state tracker has the wrong key (see "Session ID mismatch" below) |
| Deploy timed out to Mac Studio | Check `tailscale status`; if peer is on DERP relay, SSH handshake may exceed the 5s probe timeout — wait for P2P or deploy via LAN IP |
| sessions.db missing token counts | Pre-fix hook bug (Issue #901). Deploy latest, then re-run a session to repopulate. Existing rows can be backfilled by re-parsing `~/.claude/archive/conversations/**/*.jsonl` |
| doc-master returned empty verdict | Known background-agent race — the coordinator retries once with reduced context. If it still fails, the verdict is logged as `MISSING` and the pipeline proceeds with warning |

## Installation Issues

### "Commands not found after installation"

**Symptom**: After running `install.sh`, commands like `/implement` don't appear.

**Cause**: Claude Code caches commands at startup.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option A: Run /reload-plugins (reloads commands, agents, skills — ~5 seconds)
/reload-plugins

# Option B: Full restart (required if hooks or settings changed)
# 1. Fully quit Claude Code
#    Press Cmd+Q (Mac) or Ctrl+Q (Windows/Linux)
# 2. Verify process is dead
ps aux | grep -i claude | grep -v grep
# Should return nothing
# 3. Wait 5 seconds, then reopen Claude Code

# Verify commands appear
/health-check
```

### "install.sh fails or incomplete"

**Symptom**: Installation script errors or missing components.

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Check what was installed
ls -la ~/.claude/hooks/ | wc -l    # Should be ~50 hooks
ls -la ~/.claude/lib/ | wc -l      # Should be ~69 libs

# 2. Re-run installation
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akaszubski/autonomous-dev/master/install.sh)

# 3. Run /reload-plugins (or full restart if hooks/settings changed)
```

### "How do I uninstall?"

**Solution**: Use the `/sync --uninstall` command (added in v3.41.0):

```bash
# Preview what will be removed
/sync --uninstall

# Confirm with --force flag
/sync --uninstall --force

# Keep global ~/.claude/ files (only remove project files)
/sync --uninstall --force --local-only
```

Creates automatic backup before removal. Rollback available if needed.

## Development Issues

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autonomous_dev'

**Symptom**: When running tests or importing:
```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autonomous_dev'
```

**Cause**: Python can't use hyphens in package names. Directory is `autonomous-dev` but imports need `autonomous_dev`.

**Solution**: Create a symlink:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
cd plugins
ln -s autonomous-dev autonomous_dev

# Windows (Command Prompt as Admin)
cd plugins
mklink /D autonomous_dev autonomous-dev

# Verify
python3 -c "from autonomous_dev.lib import security_utils; print('OK')"
```

### "Plugin changes don't appear when testing"

**Symptom**: Edit agent/command files but changes don't show up.

**Cause**: Claude Code reads from `~/.claude/` not your development directory.

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
vim plugins/autonomous-dev/agents/implementer.md

# 2. Sync to installed location
/sync --plugin-dev

# 3. Reload or restart:
#    Changed commands/agents/skills → /reload-plugins (~5 seconds)
#    Changed hooks/settings/.env/Python libs → Full restart (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q)

# 4. Test changes
/health-check
```

### "Lib files not found by hooks"

**Symptom**: Hooks fail with import errors:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'security_utils'
```

**Cause**: Lib files not copied to `~/.claude/lib/`.

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Check lib directory
ls ~/.claude/lib/*.py | wc -l
# Should show ~69 files

# 2. If missing, re-run install or copy manually
cp plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/*.py ~/.claude/lib/

# 3. Verify imports work
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '$HOME/.claude/lib'); import security_utils; print('OK')"
```

**Note**: Commands (`/implement`, `/sweep`, etc.) now use a multi-candidate path resolver that automatically finds libs in `.claude/lib`, `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib`, or `~/.claude/lib` — in that priority order. Creating a symlink is no longer required for commands to work in consumer repos; the resolver handles both dev and installed layouts.

## Runtime Issues

### "Context budget exceeded"

**Symptom**: Token limit errors, truncated responses.

**Cause**: Too many features in one session without clearing context.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear context after each feature
/clear

# Best practice workflow:
# 1. Complete feature with /implement
# 2. Run /clear
# 3. Start next feature
```

### "Hooks not running"

**Symptom**: Expected hooks (auto-format, validation) don't trigger.

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Check hooks are installed
ls ~/.claude/hooks/*.py | head -5

# 2. Check settings configuration
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 10 '"hooks"'

# 3. Check hook is executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.py

# 4. Test hook manually
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/auto_format.py
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### "Feature doesn't align with PROJECT.md"

**Symptom**: Warning about feature not matching project goals.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Option 1: Modify feature to align with PROJECT.md goals

# Option 2: Update PROJECT.md if direction changed
vim .claude/PROJECT.md
# Update GOALS, SCOPE sections

# Option 3: Run alignment check
/align
```

## Command-Specific Issues

### "/implement stops mid-way"

**Symptom**: Pipeline doesn't complete all 8 steps.

**Solutions**:
1. Check for test failures (step 4) - fix failing tests
2. Check for security issues (step 6) - address vulnerabilities
3. Context may be full - run `/clear` and retry
4. Check agent output for specific errors

### "/implement --batch crashes"

**Symptom**: Batch processing stops unexpectedly.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Resume from where it stopped
/implement --resume <batch-id>

# Check batch state
cat .claude/batch_state.json
```

### "/sync fails"

**Symptom**: Sync command errors.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check which mode is failing
/sync --github    # Fetch from GitHub
/sync --env       # Environment sync
/sync --plugin-dev # Dev sync (requires being in autonomous-dev repo)

# For GitHub sync, ensure git remote is configured
git remote -v
```

### "/sync tries to fetch URL instead of executing script"

**Symptom**: When you run `/sync`, Claude attempts to fetch content from a URL (e.g., GitHub) instead of executing the script locally.

**Cause**: The sync.md command file should have a strong "Do NOT fetch" directive to prevent Claude from web requests. If missing or incorrectly placed, Claude may interpret the script as needing external resources.

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Verify the directive is in place
grep "Do NOT fetch" .claude/commands/sync.md
# Should output: Do NOT fetch any URLs or documentation. Execute the script below directly.

# 2. If directive is missing or incorrect, re-sync
/sync --plugin-dev

# 3. Run /reload-plugins to reload commands (or full restart if hooks/settings changed)

# 4. Test the command again
/sync --github

# 5. If still failing, check installed version
cat ~/.claude/commands/sync.md | head -15
# Should see "Do NOT fetch" in lines 1-10
```

**Note**: The "Do NOT fetch" directive must appear BEFORE the bash code block to ensure Claude reads and respects it immediately.
