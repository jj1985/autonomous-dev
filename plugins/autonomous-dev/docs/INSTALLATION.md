# Installation Guide - Tiered Approach

**Version**: 2.4.0-beta
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26
**Issue**: #15 - Installation Complexity vs Simplicity Promise

---

## Choose Your Tier

Pick the installation tier that matches your workflow:

| Tier | Who It's For | Time | What You Get |
|------|-------------|------|--------------|
| **[Basic](#basic-tier)** | Solo developer, learning | 2 min | Slash commands only |
| **[Standard](#standard-tier)** | Solo with automation | 5 min | Commands + auto-format/test hooks |
| **[Team](#team-tier)** | Team collaboration | 10 min | Full integration + GitHub + PROJECT.md |

**Not sure?** Start with **Basic** → upgrade to Standard/Team later as needed.

---

## Basic Tier

**For**: Solo developers who want explicit control
**Time**: 2 minutes
**Philosophy**: You tell Claude what to do, when to do it

### Installation (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add akaszubski/autonomous-dev

# 2. Install plugin
/plugin install autonomous-dev

# 3. First install: Restart Claude Code (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q)
#    Future updates: /reload-plugins (reloads commands/agents/skills)
#    Note: /reload-plugins does NOT reload hooks or settings
```

**Done!** All commands immediately work.

### Optional: Global CLAUDE.md

The plugin includes a global CLAUDE.md template with universal instructions for ALL your projects:
```bash
# Run setup wizard with global flag
python3 ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/autonomous-dev/plugins/autonomous-dev/hooks/setup.py --global-claude
```

This is optional for Basic tier but recommended for Standard/Team tiers.

### What You Get

**8 Slash Commands**:
- `/test` - Run all tests
- `/align` - Check PROJECT.md alignment
- `/implement` - Smart feature implementation (full pipeline, quick, or batch modes)
- `/setup` - Configuration wizard
- `/status` - Project status overview
- `/health-check` - Validate plugin components
- `/sync` - Sync plugin changes
- `/create-issue` - Create GitHub issues with research

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Write some code
# ...

# When ready, run checks manually
/test
/format  # If you want formatting

# Commit when you're satisfied
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"
```

### Upgrading from Basic

Want automation? → [Standard Tier](#standard-tier)
Want GitHub integration? → [Team Tier](#team-tier)

---

## Standard Tier

**For**: Solo developers who want automatic quality checks
**Time**: 5 minutes (Basic + 3 min setup)
**Philosophy**: Quality checks run automatically, you focus on coding

### Prerequisites

✅ Basic tier installed
✅ One of: Python project OR JavaScript/TypeScript project OR Go project

### Installation (2 Additional Steps)

```bash
# 1. Run setup wizard
/setup

# 2. Choose "Automatic Hooks" when prompted
#    This enables:
#    - Auto-format on save (black/prettier/gofmt)
#    - Auto-test before commit
#    - Security scan before commit
```

### What You Get (Basic +)

**Automatic Hooks**:
- **Auto-format**: Code formatted on every save
- **Auto-test**: Tests run before every commit
- **Security scan**: Secrets detection before commit
- **Coverage enforcement**: 80% minimum (configurable)

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Write code
# → Auto-formatted on save automatically

# Try to commit
git commit -m "Add feature"
# → Tests run automatically
# → Security scan runs automatically
# → Only commits if all pass
```

### Configuration

**Enable hooks** (if you skipped /setup):
```bash
/setup
# Choose: "Automatic Hooks"
```

**Disable hooks temporarily**:
```bash
git commit --no-verify  # Skip hooks for this commit
```

**Disable hooks permanently**:
```bash
rm .claude/settings.local.json
# Full restart required for settings changes (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q)
# /reload-plugins does NOT reload settings
```

### Upgrading from Standard

Want GitHub integration? → [Team Tier](#team-tier)

---

## Team Tier

**For**: Teams collaborating with GitHub
**Time**: 10 minutes (Standard + 5 min setup)
**Philosophy**: Fully automated workflow with sprint tracking

### Prerequisites

✅ Standard tier installed
✅ GitHub repository
✅ GitHub Personal Access Token (we'll help you create one)

### Installation (3 Additional Steps)

```bash
# 1. Create PROJECT.md (strategic direction)
/setup
# Choose: "Create PROJECT.md from template"
# Fill in: GOALS, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS

# 2. Setup GitHub integration
/setup
# Choose: "GitHub Integration"
# Follow prompts to:
#  - Create GitHub Personal Access Token
#  - Add token to .env
#  - Create GitHub Milestone

# 3. Verify everything works
/align
/health-check
```

### What You Get (Standard +)

**PROJECT.md Governance**:
- All features validated against strategic goals
- `/implement` checks alignment before starting
- `/status` tracks progress toward PROJECT.md goals
- **Zero scope creep** - Claude won't implement out-of-scope features

**GitHub Integration**:
- Sprint tracking via Milestones
- Automatic issue creation from test failures
- PR description generation
- Commit message generation following conventional commits

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Define what you're building
vim PROJECT.md
# GOALS: Build REST API
# SCOPE: CRUD operations, pagination
# OUT OF SCOPE: Admin UI, real-time features

# Autonomous implementation
/implement "add user authentication"
# → Validates against PROJECT.md goals
# → Researches existing patterns
# → Writes tests (TDD)
# → Implements code
# → Runs security scan
# → Updates documentation
# → Creates commit

# Track progress
/status
# Shows: 40% toward "Performance" goal
```

### PROJECT.md Template

Minimal example:
```markdown
# Project Context

## GOALS
1. Build a REST API for blog posts
2. 80%+ test coverage
3. < 100ms response time

## SCOPE

### In Scope
- CRUD operations
- Pagination
- Search

### Out of Scope
- Admin UI
- Real-time features
- GraphQL

## CONSTRAINTS
- Use Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL only
- No external API dependencies
```

### GitHub Setup

**Create Personal Access Token**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
4. Copy token

**Add to .env**:
```bash
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here" > .env
```

**Create Milestone**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO/milestones
2. Click: "New milestone"
3. Title: "Sprint 1" (or current sprint name)
4. Set due date
5. Create

## Troubleshooting by Tier

### Basic Tier Issues

**"Commands don't work after install"**:
- Run `/reload-plugins` to reload commands/agents/skills
- If first install or hooks/settings changed: full restart (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q)
- Verify: `/plugin list` shows autonomous-dev

**"Want automation but don't know where to start"**:
- Upgrade to [Standard Tier](#standard-tier)

### Standard Tier Issues

**"Hooks not running"**:
- Check: `.claude/settings.local.json` exists
- Check: Formatter installed (black/prettier/gofmt)
- See: [ERR-101] docs/ERROR_MESSAGES.md

**"Tests fail on commit"**:
- This is working as intended!
- Fix tests: `pytest -v`
- OR skip once: `git commit --no-verify`

**"Too much automation, want control back"**:
- Downgrade to [Basic Tier](#basic-tier)
- Remove: `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Full restart required for settings changes (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q); /reload-plugins does NOT reload settings

### Team Tier Issues

**"PROJECT.md validation failing"**:
- Check: PROJECT.md has GOALS, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS sections
- Validate: `/align`
- Template: `.claude/templates/PROJECT.md`

**"GitHub authentication failing"**:
- Check: `.env` file exists with GITHUB_TOKEN
- Check: Token has `repo` scope
- Test: `gh auth status`
- See: [ERR-103] docs/ERROR_MESSAGES.md

**"Claude won't implement my feature"**:
- Is it in PROJECT.md SCOPE?
- If yes: Update request to align with goals
- If no: Update PROJECT.md to include it

**"Too much governance, want freedom"**:
- Downgrade to [Standard Tier](#standard-tier)
- Use `/implement` without PROJECT.md validation
- GitHub integration remains optional

## Migration Between Tiers

### Basic → Standard

```bash
/setup
# Choose: "Automatic Hooks"
# Full restart required for hook changes (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q)
# /reload-plugins does NOT reload hooks
```

### Standard → Team

```bash
# 1. Create PROJECT.md
/setup
# Choose: "Create PROJECT.md"

# 2. Setup GitHub
/setup
# Choose: "GitHub Integration"

# 3. Verify
/align
```

### Team → Standard (Downgrade)

```bash
# Keep hooks, remove PROJECT.md validation
mv PROJECT.md PROJECT.md.backup  # Optional: keep for reference
rm .env  # Remove GitHub token

# Features still work, just no validation
```

### Standard → Basic (Downgrade)

```bash
# Remove automation
rm .claude/settings.local.json

# Full restart required for settings changes (Cmd+Q / Ctrl+Q)
# /reload-plugins does NOT reload settings
# Commands still work, no automatic hooks
```
