"""
Batch State Manager - State-based tracking for /implement --batch command.

Manages persistent state for batch feature processing. Enables crash recovery,
resume functionality, and multi-feature batch processing.

DESIGN (v3.34.0): Compaction-resilient - all state is externalized (batch_state.json,
git commits, GitHub issues). Batches survive Claude Code's auto-compaction because
each feature bootstraps fresh from external state, not conversation memory.

Key Features:
1. Persistent state storage (.claude/batch_state.json)
2. Progress tracking (completed, failed, current feature)
3. Atomic writes with file locking
4. Security validations (CWE-22 path traversal, CWE-59 symlinks)
5. Crash recovery and resume

State Structure:
    {
        "batch_id": "batch-20251116-123456",
        "features_file": "/path/to/features.txt",
        "total_features": 10,
        "features": ["feature 1", "feature 2", ...],
        "current_index": 3,
        "completed_features": [0, 1, 2],
        "failed_features": [
            {"feature_index": 5, "error_message": "Tests failed", "timestamp": "..."}
        ],
        "context_token_estimate": 145000,
        "auto_clear_count": 2,
        "auto_clear_events": [
            {"feature_index": 2, "tokens_before": 155000, "timestamp": "..."},
            {"feature_index": 5, "tokens_before": 152000, "timestamp": "..."}
        ],
        "created_at": "2025-11-16T10:00:00Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-11-16T14:30:00Z",
        "status": "in_progress"  # in_progress, completed, failed
    }

Workflow:
    1. /implement --batch reads features.txt
    2. create_batch_state() creates initial state
    3. For each feature:
       a. Process with /implement
       b. update_batch_progress() increments current_index
       c. should_auto_clear() checks if threshold exceeded
       d. If yes: record_auto_clear_event() → /clear → resume
    4. cleanup_batch_state() removes state file on completion

Usage:
    from batch_state_manager import (
        create_batch_state,
        load_batch_state,
        save_batch_state,
        update_batch_progress,
        record_auto_clear_event,
        should_auto_clear,
        get_next_pending_feature,
        cleanup_batch_state,
    )
    from path_utils import get_batch_state_file

    # Create new batch
    state = create_batch_state("/path/to/features.txt", ["feature 1", "feature 2"])
    save_batch_state(get_batch_state_file(), state)

    # Process features
    while True:
        next_feature = get_next_pending_feature(state)
        if next_feature is None:
            break

        # Process feature...

        # Update progress
        update_batch_progress(get_batch_state_file(), state.current_index, "completed", 10000)

        # Check auto-clear
        state = load_batch_state(get_batch_state_file())
        if should_auto_clear(state):
            record_auto_clear_event(get_batch_state_file(), state.current_index, state.context_token_estimate)
            # /clear command...
            state = load_batch_state(get_batch_state_file())

    # Cleanup
    cleanup_batch_state(get_batch_state_file())

    Atomic Write Design:
    ====================
    1. CREATE: tempfile.mkstemp() creates .tmp file in same directory
    2. WRITE: JSON data written to .tmp file

    ==================
    - Process crash during write: Temp file left, target unchanged
    - Process crash during rename: Atomic, so target is old or new (not partial)
    - Concurrent writes: Each gets unique temp file (last write wins)
