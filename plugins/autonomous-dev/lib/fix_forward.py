"""Opportunistic fix-forward classification for pre-existing test failures.

Provides utilities to parse pytest output for failing tests, classify them
against a known baseline, and format issue bodies for auto-filing.

Used by:
- Pipeline STEP 1 (implement.md) to capture baseline failing tests
- Pipeline STEP 8 (implement.md) to classify failures as pre-existing vs new
- Implementer agent to decide whether to fix or document failures

Issue #860: Opportunistic fix-forward — agents should fix pre-existing failures within reach.
