GenAI Prompts for Claude Code Hooks

This module contains all GenAI prompts used across the 5 GenAI-enhanced hooks.
Centralizing prompts enables:
- Single source of truth for prompt management
- Easy A/B testing and prompt improvements
- Consistent prompt versions across all hooks
- Independent testing of prompt quality
- Version control and history tracking

Patterns used:
- All prompts are uppercase SNAKE_CASE constants
- Each prompt is a string template with {variables}
- Docstrings explain the prompt's purpose and expected output
- Prompts are optimized for Claude Haiku (fast, cost-effective)
