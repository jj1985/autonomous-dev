# Testing Guide

What to test, how to test it, and what NOT to test — for a plugin made of prompt files, Python glue, and configuration.

## Philosophy: GenAI-First Testing

Traditional unit tests work for deterministic logic. But most bugs in this project are **drift** — docs diverge from code, agents contradict commands, component counts go stale. GenAI congruence tests catch these. Unit tests don't.

**Decision rule**: Can you write `assert x == y` and it won't break next week? → Unit test. Otherwise → GenAI test or structural test.

---

## Three Test Patterns

### 1. Judge Pattern (single artifact evaluation)

An LLM evaluates one artifact against criteria. Use for: doc completeness, security posture, architectural intent.

```python
pytestmark = [pytest.mark.genai]

def test_agents_documented_in_claude_md(self, genai):
    agents_on_disk = list_agents()
    claude_md = Path("CLAUDE.md").read_text()
    result = genai.judge(
        question="Does CLAUDE.md document all active agents?",
        context=f"Agents on disk: {agents_on_disk}\nCLAUDE.md:\n{claude_md[:3000]}",
        criteria="All active agents should be referenced. Score by coverage %."
    )
    assert result["score"] >= 5, f"Gap: {result['reasoning']}"
```

### 2. Congruence Pattern (two-source cross-reference)

The most valuable pattern. An LLM checks two files that should agree. Use for: command↔agent alignment, FORBIDDEN lists, config↔reality.

```python
def test_implement_and_implementer_share_forbidden_list(self, genai):
    implement = Path("commands/implement.md").read_text()
    implementer = Path("agents/implementer.md").read_text()
    result = genai.judge(
        question="Do these files have matching FORBIDDEN behavior lists?",
        context=f"implement.md:\n{implement[:5000]}\nimplementer.md:\n{implementer[:5000]}",
        criteria="Both should define same enforcement gates. Score 10=identical, 0=contradictory."
    )
    assert result["score"] >= 5
```

### 3. Cross-Validation Pattern (two sources that must match)

No LLM needed. When two configs/files must stay in sync, read both and compare directly. Catches the #1 recurring bug class: adding something to one place but not the other.

```python
def test_policy_and_hook_in_sync(self):
    """Policy always_allowed and hook NATIVE_TOOLS must be identical."""
    policy_tools = set(json.load(open(POLICY_FILE))["tools"]["always_allowed"])
    hook_tools = hook.NATIVE_TOOLS
    # Check BOTH directions
    assert policy_tools - hook_tools == set(), f"In policy not hook: {policy_tools - hook_tools}"
    assert hook_tools - policy_tools == set(), f"In hook not policy: {hook_tools - policy_tools}"
```

**When to use**: Any time two files define overlapping data — permissions↔hook, manifest↔disk, config↔worktree copy, command frontmatter↔policy.
**Key principle**: Read both sources dynamically. Never hardcode expected values in the test itself.

### 4. Structural Pattern (dynamic filesystem discovery)

No LLM needed. Discover components dynamically and assert structural properties. Use for: component existence, manifest sync, skill loading.

```python
def test_all_active_skills_have_content(self):
    skills_dir = Path("plugins/autonomous-dev/skills")
    for skill in skills_dir.iterdir():
        if skill.name == "archived" or not skill.is_dir():
            continue
        skill_md = skill / "SKILL.md"
        assert skill_md.exists(), f"Skill {skill.name} missing SKILL.md"
        assert len(skill_md.read_text()) > 100, f"Skill {skill.name} is a hollow shell"
```

### 5. Property-Based Pattern (hypothesis invariants)

Define properties that must always hold, instead of testing specific examples. Catches 23-37% more bugs than example-based tests. Use for: pure functions, serialization, data transformations, parsers.

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_sort_preserves_elements(arr):
    """Invariant: sorting never loses or adds elements."""
    result = sorted(arr)
    assert set(result) == set(arr)
    assert len(result) == len(arr)

@given(st.dictionaries(st.text(min_size=1), st.text()))
def test_config_roundtrip(config):
    """Invariant: serialize → deserialize = identity."""
    assert json.loads(json.dumps(config)) == config
```

**When to use**: Pure functions, roundtrips, idempotent operations, parsers.
**When NOT to use**: Agent prompts (use GenAI judge), filesystem checks (use structural).

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

### Hardcoded counts
```python
# BAD — breaks every time a component is added/removed
assert len(agents) == 14
assert hook_count == 17

# GOOD — minimum thresholds + structural checks
assert len(agents) >= 8, "Pipeline needs at least 8 agents"
assert "implementer.md" in agent_names, "Core agent missing"
```

### Hardcoded intermediary lists (the worst anti-pattern)
```python
# BAD — test has its OWN copy of expected data, drifts from both real sources
VALID_TOOLS = {"Read", "Write", "Edit"}  # stale copy in test
EXPECTED_COMMANDS = {"implement.md": {"Read", "Write"}}  # another stale copy
assert actual_tools == VALID_TOOLS  # passes even when BOTH sources are wrong

# GOOD — cross-validate real sources directly against each other
policy_tools = set(json.load(open(POLICY_FILE))["tools"]["always_allowed"])
hook_tools = hook.NATIVE_TOOLS
assert policy_tools == hook_tools, f"Drift: policy-only={policy_tools - hook_tools}"

# BEST — add GenAI test to catch gaps in BOTH sources
result = genai.judge(
    question="Are any known tools missing from this list?",
    context=json.dumps(sorted(hook_tools)),
    criteria="Check against known Claude Code native tools..."
)
```

**Rule**: When two configs must stay in sync, read both dynamically and compare. Never create a third copy in the test — that's three things that can drift instead of two.

### Testing config values
```python
# BAD — breaks on every config update
assert settings["version"] == "3.51.0"

# GOOD — test structure, not values
assert "version" in settings
assert re.match(r"\d+\.\d+\.\d+", settings["version"])
```

### Testing file paths that move
```python
# BAD — breaks on renames/moves
assert Path("plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/old_name.py").exists()

# GOOD — use glob discovery
assert any(Path("plugins/autonomous-dev/lib").glob("*skill*"))
```

**Rule**: If the test itself is the thing that needs updating most often, delete it.

## Test Tiers (auto-categorized by directory)

No manual `@pytest.mark` needed — directory location determines tier.

```
tests/
├── regression/
│   ├── smoke/           # Tier 0: Critical path (<5s) — CI GATE
│   ├── regression/      # Tier 1: Feature protection (<30s)
│   ├── extended/        # Tier 2: Deep validation (<5min)
│   └── progression/     # Tier 3: Forward-looking tests (next milestone)
├── unit/                # Isolated functions (<1s each)
├── integration/         # Multi-component workflows (<30s)
├── genai/               # LLM-as-judge (opt-in via --genai flag)
└── archived/            # Excluded from runs
```

**Where to put a new test**:
- Protecting a released critical path? → `regression/smoke/`
- Protecting a released feature? → `regression/regression/`
- Testing a pure function? → `unit/`
- Testing component interaction? → `integration/`
- Checking doc↔code drift? → `genai/`

**Run commands**:
```bash
pytest -m smoke                    # CI gate
pytest -m "smoke or regression"    # Feature protection
pytest tests/genai/ --genai        # GenAI validation (opt-in)
```

## GenAI Test Infrastructure

```python
# tests/genai/conftest.py provides two fixtures:
# - genai: Gemini Flash via OpenRouter (cheap, fast)
# - genai_smart: Haiku 4.5 via OpenRouter (complex reasoning)
# Requires: OPENROUTER_API_KEY env var + --genai pytest flag
# Cost: ~$0.02 per full run with 24h response caching
```

**Scaffold for any repo**: `/scaffold-genai-uat` generates the full `tests/genai/` setup with portable client, universal tests, and project-specific congruence tests auto-discovered by GenAI.

## What to Test vs What Not To

| Test This | With This | Not This |
|-----------|-----------|----------|

| Two configs in sync | Cross-validation | Hardcoded intermediary list |
| Component existence | Structural (glob) | Hardcoded counts |
| FORBIDDEN list sync | GenAI congruence | Manual comparison |
| Security posture | GenAI judge | Regex scanning |
| Config structure | Structural | Config values |
| Agent output quality | GenAI judge | Output string matching |

## Hard Rules

1. **100% pass rate required** — ALL tests must pass, 0 failures. Coverage targets are separate.
2. **Specification-driven** — tests define the contract; implementation satisfies it.
3. **0 new skips** — `@pytest.mark.skip` is forbidden for new code. Fix it or adjust expectations.
4. **Regression test for every bug fix** — named `test_regression_issue_NNN_description`.
5. **No test is better than a flaky test** — if it fails randomly, fix or delete it.
6. **GenAI tests are opt-in** — `--genai` flag required, no surprise API costs.
7. **Property over example** — prefer `hypothesis` invariants over hardcoded input/output pairs where applicable.
