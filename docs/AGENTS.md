---

## Overview

13 active agents with skill integration. Each agent has specific responsibilities and references relevant skills.

**Active Agents**: commit-message-generator, continuous-improvement-analyst, doc-master, implementer, issue-creator, planner, quality-validator, researcher, researcher-local, reviewer, security-auditor, test-coverage-auditor, test-master

**Archived Agents** (16, in `agents/archived/`): advisor, alignment-analyzer, alignment-validator, brownfield-analyzer, data-curator, data-quality-validator, distributed-training-coordinator, experiment-critic, orchestrator, postmortem-analyst, pr-description-generator, project-bootstrapper, project-progress-tracker, project-status-analyzer, setup-wizard, sync-validator

## Model Tier Strategy (Issue #108, Updated #147)

Agent model assignments optimized for cost-performance balance (9 active agents):

### Tier 1: Haiku (4 agents)

Fast, cost-effective for pattern matching:

- **researcher-local**: Search codebase patterns
- **reviewer**: Code quality checks
- **doc-master**: Documentation sync
- **data-curator**: A-grade data pipeline orchestration

### Tier 2: Sonnet (4 agents)

Balanced reasoning for implementation:

- **implementer**: Code implementation
- **test-master**: TDD test generation
- **planner**: Architecture planning
- **issue-creator**: GitHub issue creation

### Tier 3: Opus (1 agent)

Maximum depth for security and complex analysis:

- **security-auditor**: OWASP security scanning

### Rationale

- **Tier 1 (Haiku)**: Cost optimization for well-defined tasks (40-60% cost reduction vs Opus) - pattern matching, code review, documentation, data pipeline orchestration
- **Tier 2 (Sonnet)**: Sweet spot for development work requiring both speed and reasoning
- **Tier 3 (Opus)**: Reserved for high-risk security decisions

**Performance Impact**: Optimized tier assignments reduce costs by 40-60% while maintaining quality.

**Purpose**: Search codebase for existing patterns and similar implementations
**Model**: Haiku (Tier 1 - cost optimized for pattern matching)
**Skills**: research-patterns
**Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob (local filesystem access only)
**Execution**: Step 1A of /implement workflow (parallel with researcher-web)
**Output Format**: JSON schema with similar_implementations array plus implementation_guidance and testing_guidance sections
  - **similar_implementations**: Existing patterns matching the feature request
  - **implementation_guidance**: Reusable functions, import patterns, error handling patterns
    - reusable_functions: Functions with file location, purpose, and usage examples
    - import_patterns: Recommended imports with context for when to use
    - error_handling_patterns: Error handling approaches with file/line references
  - **testing_guidance**: Testing patterns found in the codebase
    - test_file_patterns: Structure of tests, pytest patterns, common fixtures
    - edge_cases_to_test: Edge cases identified in similar code with expected behavior
    - mocking_patterns: Mocking approaches used in existing tests with examples
**Research Persistence** (Issue #151): Optionally persists significant research findings to `docs/research/` for future reuse

### researcher-web

**Purpose**: Research web best practices and industry standards
**Model**: Haiku (Tier 1 - cost optimized for pattern matching)
**Skills**: research-patterns, documentation-guide
**Tools**: WebSearch, WebFetch (external research only)
**Execution**: Step 1B of /implement workflow (parallel with researcher-local)
**Output Format**: JSON schema with antipatterns array plus implementation_guidance and testing_guidance sections
  - **antipatterns**: Industry-standard pitfalls and how to avoid them
  - **implementation_guidance**: Best practices for design and performance
    - design_patterns: Patterns like Factory, Strategy, Decorator with usage context and examples
    - performance_tips: Optimization techniques with impact assessment
    - library_integration_tips: Best practices for popular libraries (requests, async, etc)
  - **testing_guidance**: Industry best practices for testing

    - coverage_recommendations: Coverage targets by area (error handling 100%, happy path 80%)
    - testing_antipatterns: Common testing mistakes and preferred alternatives
**Research Persistence** (Issue #151): Persists substantial research findings (2+ best practices, 3+ sources) to `docs/research/` with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming (e.g., JWT_AUTHENTICATION_RESEARCH.md)
**Related**: Deprecated researcher.md combined functionality split into local/web agents (Issue #128); output expanded in Issue #130

### planner

**Purpose**: Architecture planning and design
**Model**: Sonnet (Tier 2 - balanced reasoning for complex planning)
**Skills**: architecture-patterns, api-design, database-design, testing-guide
**Execution**: Step 2 of /implement workflow (after merging research findings from Step 1.1)

### test-master

**Purpose**: TDD specialist (writes tests first)
**Model**: Sonnet (Tier 2 - strong reasoning for comprehensive test design)
**Skills**: testing-guide, security-patterns
**Execution**: Step 3 of /implement workflow
**Research Context**: Receives testing_guidance from researcher-local and researcher-web (Issue #130)
  - Uses test_file_patterns, edge_cases_to_test, mocking_patterns from researchers
  - Falls back to Grep/Glob pattern discovery if research context not provided
**Context Isolation**: Runs in separate context. Writes tests to disk for implementer. See testing-guide skill for context isolation patterns.

### implementer

**Purpose**: Code implementation (makes tests pass)
**Model**: Sonnet (Tier 2 - balanced reasoning for code implementation)
**Skills**: python-standards, observability
**Execution**: Step 4 of /implement workflow
**Research Context**: Receives implementation_guidance from researcher-local and researcher-web (Issue #130)
  - Uses reusable_functions, import_patterns, error_handling_patterns from researchers
  - Uses design_patterns, performance_tips, library_integration_tips from web research
  - Falls back to Grep/Glob pattern discovery if research context not provided
**Context Isolation**: Runs in separate context. Reads only test files from disk, not test-master's reasoning. See testing-guide skill for context isolation patterns.
**Remediation Mode**: Re-invoked by the STEP 6.5 Remediation Gate when the reviewer or security-auditor return BLOCKING findings. In this mode the implementer fixes only the cited BLOCKING findings (verbatim from the gate), runs pytest to confirm 0 failures, and reports what changed. WARNING findings are out of scope during remediation.

### reviewer

**Purpose**: Quality gate (code review) — read-only; reports issues, never modifies files
**Model**: Haiku (Tier 1 - cost optimized for pattern-based code review)
**Skills**: code-review, python-standards
**Execution**: Step 5 of /implement workflow (parallel validation - 60% faster with Phase 7 optimization)
**Read-Only Enforcement** (Issue #461): Reviewer MUST NOT use Write or Edit tools on any file. When issues are found, they are reported as FINDINGS with file:line references and the verdict is set to REQUEST_CHANGES. The coordinator relays findings to the implementer. This prevents post-review edits that bypass the STEP 5 test gate and introduce unreviewed changes.
**FINDINGS Format**: Each finding uses a structured `FINDING-{N}` schema with mandatory `file:line` reference, severity (`BLOCKING` or `WARNING`), category, issue description, detail, and suggested fix. BLOCKING findings trigger the STEP 6.5 Remediation Gate; WARNING findings are advisory only.
**Verdict**: `APPROVE` (all findings WARNING or none) or `REQUEST_CHANGES` (any BLOCKING finding present). STEP 6.5 parses this verdict to determine whether to enter the remediation loop.

### security-auditor

**Purpose**: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
**Model**: Opus (Tier 3 - maximum depth for critical security analysis)
**Skills**: security-patterns, python-standards
**Execution**: Step 5 of /implement workflow (parallel validation - 60% faster with Phase 7 optimization)

### doc-master

**Purpose**: Documentation synchronization and research management
**Model**: Haiku (Tier 1 - cost optimized for structured documentation updates)
**Skills**: documentation-guide, consistency-enforcement, git-workflow, cross-reference-validation, documentation-currency
**Execution**: Step 5 of /implement workflow (parallel validation - 60% faster with Phase 7 optimization)
**Research Documentation** (Issue #151): Validates and maintains research documentation in `docs/research/` - enforces naming conventions, format standards, README sync, and parity validation

### data-curator

**Purpose**: Orchestrate 9-stage A-grade data pipeline for LLM training (Issue #311)
**Model**: Haiku (Tier 1 - cost optimized for data processing orchestration)
**Skills**: quality-scoring
**Tools**: Bash, Read, Write, Grep, Glob (filesystem and processing access)
**Execution**: Utility agent for training data preparation workflows
**Pipeline Stages** (9-stage orchestration):
  1. **Extract**: Persona-driven extraction from diverse formats (JSONL, Parquet, CSV)

  7. **Generate**: DPO pair generation and RLVR trace creation
  8. **Mix**: Weighted dataset mixing for domain balance
  9. **Validate**: Final quality checks and data poisoning detection
**Checkpoint Integration**: Load/save pipeline state via CheckpointManager for resume capability across interruptions
**Training Metrics**: Integrates with training_metrics.py library (IFD scoring, DPO validation, RLVR assessment)
**Security**: Path validation (CWE-22), log injection prevention (CWE-117), input validation (CWE-20)
**Output**: Structured JSON pipeline report with stage metrics, quality summary, and checkpoint state

## Agent-Skill Integration

Active agents reference relevant skills via `skills:` frontmatter (Issue #35, #143, #147). Claude Code 2.0 auto-loads skills when agents are spawned.

**How It Works**:
1. Each agent's prompt includes a "Relevant Skills" section
2. Skills auto-activate based on task keywords
3. Claude loads full SKILL.md content only when relevant
4. Context stays efficient while providing specialized knowledge

**See Also**: [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md) for skills overview.

---

## Parallel Validation (Phase 7)

Three agents execute in parallel during Step 5 of /implement:

- **reviewer**: Code quality validation
- **security-auditor**: Security scanning
- **doc-master**: Documentation updates

**Performance**: Sequential 5 minutes → Parallel 2 minutes (60% faster)

**Implementation**: Three Task tool calls in single response enables parallel execution
