# Workflow Discipline

**REQUIRED**: Use `/implement` for all code changes. This is not optional.

Claude MUST use `/implement` for code changes because the pipeline enforces quality at every step.

---

## Why /implement Produces Better Results

**What the pipeline enforces that direct implementation skips:**

| Step | Direct Implementation | `/implement` Pipeline |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Alignment | None | PROJECT.md validation (blocks misaligned work) |
| Research | None | Codebase + web research (catches duplicates) |
| Testing | Optional, after code | TDD enforced (tests BEFORE code) |
| Security | None | OWASP scan by security-auditor agent |
| Documentation | Manual, "later" | Auto-synced by doc-master agent |
| Review | None | Code review by reviewer agent |

**Benefits**: Research catches duplicates, TDD catches bugs, security blocks vulns, docs stay synced.

---

## When to Use Each Approach

**STOP AND CHECK**: Before writing ANY code, ask: "Am I about to write new logic?" If yes → `/implement`.

**Exceptions** (direct implementation allowed):
- Documentation updates (.md files only)
- Configuration changes (.json, .yaml, .toml)
- Typo fixes (1-2 lines, no logic changes)

**REQUIRED /implement** (no exceptions):
- New functions, classes, methods
- Bug fixes requiring logic changes
- Feature additions
- API changes
- Anything that should have tests

**Default Rule**: If unsure, use `/implement`. Quality-safe default.

---

## Time Comparison

| Step | Direct Implementation | /implement |
|------|----------------------|-----------|
| Research | Manual (you do it) | Automatic (2-3 min) |
| Tests | Manual (you write them) | Automatic (TDD enforced) |
| Security | Manual (you audit) | Automatic (security-auditor) |
| Docs | Manual (you update) | Automatic (doc-master) |
| Git | Manual (you commit/push) | Automatic (auto-git) |
| **Total effort** | High (all manual) | Low (orchestrated) |
| **Total time** | Variable | 15-25 min |

---

## Enforcement: Deterministic Only (Issue #141)

**What IS enforced** (deterministic rules):
- `gh issue create` blocked → Use `/create-issue` instead
- `.env` edits blocked → Protects secrets
- `git push --force` blocked → Protects history
- Quality gates → Tests must pass before commit

**What is NOT enforced** (intent detection removed):
- "implement X" patterns → Not detected (Claude rephrases)
- Line count thresholds → Not detected (Claude makes small edits)
- "Significant change" detection → Not detected (easily bypassed)

**Why intent detection was removed** (Issue #141):
- Hooks see tool calls, not Claude's reasoning
- Claude bypasses via: Bash heredocs, small edits, rephrasing
- False positives frustrate users (doc updates blocked)
- False negatives miss violations (small cumulative edits)

**The new approach**: Persuasion + Convenience + Skills
1. CLAUDE.md explains WHY /implement is better (data-driven)
2. /implement is faster than manual implementation
3. Skills inject knowledge into agents (Issue #140)
4. Deterministic hooks block only verifiable violations

---

## Graduated Enforcement Levels (Issue #246)

The /implement workflow enforcement supports graduated levels to balance discipline and friction:

### Enforcement Levels

| Level | Behavior | Use Case | Environment Variable |
|-------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **OFF** | Allow all changes, no enforcement | Development/learning | `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=off` |
| **WARN** | Allow all changes, log warnings to stderr | Monitoring without friction | `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=warn` |
| **SUGGEST** | Allow all changes, suggest /implement in response | Default - guidance without blocking | `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=suggest` (default) |
| **BLOCK** | Deny significant changes, require /implement | Strict teams, production | `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=block` |

### Configuration

**New Environment Variable** (recommended):
```bash
# Set enforcement level
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=off      # Disable enforcement
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=warn     # Warn on violations
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=suggest  # Suggest /implement (default)
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=block    # Block violations (strictest)
```

**Legacy Variable** (backward compatible):
```bash
ENFORCE_WORKFLOW_STRICT=false   # Maps to OFF (disabled)
ENFORCE_WORKFLOW_STRICT=true    # Maps to BLOCK (strictest)
```

**Precedence**: `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL` takes precedence over `ENFORCE_WORKFLOW_STRICT`

### Alignment Gate (Issue #585)

When `/implement` is active, `unified_pre_tool.py` enforces that STEP 2 (PROJECT.md alignment) must complete before any code writes are allowed:

- **Detection**: `_has_alignment_passed()` reads the pipeline state file and checks `alignment_passed: true`.
- **Behavior**: If `/implement` is active and `alignment_passed` is not yet set, coordinator Write/Edit/Bash to code files are denied with the message "ALIGNMENT GATE: /implement is active but STEP 2 (PROJECT.md alignment) has not passed yet."
- **HMAC**: `alignment_passed` is included in the HMAC-signed pipeline state to prevent tampering. The gate fails closed on any HMAC failure or missing state.
- **Scope**: Code files only (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, etc.). Config files and docs are exempt.
- **Purpose**: Guarantees alignment validation is never skipped under time or context pressure — the hook enforces it at the tool level, not just as a prompt instruction.

### Explicit /implement Hard Block (Issue #528)

When the user explicitly invokes `/implement`, the hook enters a higher enforcement mode regardless of `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL`:

- **Detection**: `/implement` writes `{"explicitly_invoked": true, ...}` to `/tmp/implement_pipeline_state.json` on startup.
- **Behavior**: If `explicitly_invoked` is true and `ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL` is not `off`, the coordinator is blocked from writing code files directly. Code changes must be delegated to pipeline agents (`implementer`, `test-master`, `doc-master`).
- **Scope**: Code files only (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, etc.). Config files, docs (`.md`), and non-code files are exempt.
- **TTL**: Block expires 2 hours after session start. State file cleaned up after STEP 15.
- **Purpose**: Prevents the coordinator from bypassing specialist agents during an active `/implement` session.

### Default Behavior (v3.49.0+)

By default, enforcement level is **SUGGEST**:
- Claude can make code changes directly
- If significant code detected, Claude gets a suggestion to use `/implement`
- No blocking, no friction - purely informational
- Users can opt-in to stricter levels as needed

### What Each Level Does

**OFF**:
- Disables all enforcement for the hook
- All edits allowed without restriction
- No logging or warnings
- Use in early development phases

**WARN**:
- Allows all edits to proceed
- Logs violations to stderr with timestamps
- Useful for monitoring without disrupting workflows
- Violations appear in console/logs for auditing

**SUGGEST** (Default):
- Allows all edits to proceed
- Includes /implement suggestion in Claude's response when significant code detected
- Non-blocking guidance toward better workflow
- Balances discipline with user friction
- Most suitable for most teams

**BLOCK**:
- Denies significant code edits (new functions, classes, >10 lines)
- Forces use of /implement for meaningful work
- Allows minor edits (typos, config, docs)
- Strictly enforces workflow discipline
- Best for teams with high-quality requirements or regulated environments

---

## Enforcement Layers (Issue #250)

The /implement workflow is enforced across three deterministic layers:

### Layer 1: Git Bypass Prevention (block_git_bypass Hook)

**PreCommit hook that blocks git command bypasses**.

Blocked commands:
```bash
git commit --no-verify        # BLOCKED - Bypasses pre-commit hooks
git commit --no-gpg-sign      # BLOCKED - Bypasses GPG signing
```

What this prevents:
- Committing code that fails tests
- Committing code without running security checks
- Bypassing documentation validation
- Bypassing linting and formatting

Configuration:
```bash
# .env file
ALLOW_GIT_BYPASS=false  # Default: false (strict)
ALLOW_GIT_BYPASS=true   # Emergency bypass only (not recommended)
```

Log location: `logs/workflow_violations.log` (JSON Lines format)

### Layer 2: Protected Paths Enforcement (enforce_implementation_workflow Hook)

**PreToolUse hook that enforces code quality with configurable levels** (Issue #246).

This hook works at four graduated levels (new in v3.49.0):

**OFF**: Allow all changes unconditionally
**WARN**: Allow changes but warn about significant code
**SUGGEST** (default): Allow changes, suggest /implement when significant code detected
**BLOCK**: Deny significant code changes, require /implement workflow

Protected paths (always protected, even at SUGGEST level):
```
.claude/commands/*.md        # Command definitions
.claude/agents/*.md          # Agent definitions
plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/* # Core library infrastructure
```

What this prevents:
- Significant code changes outside the /implement workflow
- Claude autonomously editing system paths (protected at all levels)
- Bypassing the /implement pipeline for meaningful work

Exemptions:
- Allowed agents: `implementer`, `test-master`, `doc-master`
- These are the pipeline agents authorized to write code/tests/docs during `/implement`

Configuration:
```bash
# .env file
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=off       # Disable enforcement
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=warn      # Warn on violations
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=suggest   # Suggest /implement (default)
ENFORCEMENT_LEVEL=block     # Strictly enforce /implement

# Legacy variable (backward compatible)
ENFORCE_WORKFLOW_STRICT=false   # Maps to OFF
ENFORCE_WORKFLOW_STRICT=true    # Maps to BLOCK
```

Violations logged to: `logs/workflow_violations.log` (JSON Lines format)

### Layer 3: Pipeline Order Enforcement (enforce_pipeline_order Hook)

**PreToolUse hook that prevents skipping prerequisite agents**.

This hook tracks Task tool calls and ensures that when running `/implement`, agents are invoked in the required order:

1. researcher-local (codebase analysis)
2. researcher-web or general-purpose (web best practices research)
3. planner (implementation plan)
4. test-master (TDD tests)
5. implementer (production code)

If the implementer agent is invoked before all prerequisites have run, the hook BLOCKS the implementer with a detailed error message.

What this prevents:
- Skipping research phase (jumping to implementation)
- Skipping planning phase (no strategy before coding)
- Skipping TDD phase (no tests before implementation)
- Partial pipeline execution (e.g., only research, then implement)

Configuration:
```bash
# .env file
ENFORCE_PIPELINE_ORDER=true   # Default: enabled
ENFORCE_PIPELINE_ORDER=false  # Disable enforcement (not recommended)
```

State tracking:
- Session state file: `/tmp/implement_pipeline_state.json` (configurable via `PIPELINE_STATE_FILE`)
- Tracks: agents_invoked, prerequisites_met, session_start timestamp
- File locking ensures thread-safe concurrent operations
- State resets when a new /implement session starts (>2 hours since last activity)

Example error message:
```
⛔ PIPELINE ORDER VIOLATION - IMPLEMENTER BLOCKED

You are attempting to invoke the implementer agent, but required prerequisite
agents have not been run yet.

MISSING PREREQUISITES:
  - researcher-local (codebase analysis)
  - planner (implementation plan)

AGENTS INVOKED SO FAR: (none)

REQUIRED PIPELINE ORDER:
1. researcher-local (codebase patterns)
2. researcher-web / general-purpose (web best practices)
3. planner (implementation plan)
4. test-master (TDD tests)
5. implementer (production code) ← YOU ARE HERE

⚠️ DO NOT SKIP STEPS. Go back and invoke the missing agents first.
```

### Layer 4: Workflow Violation Audit Logging

**workflow_violation_logger.py library provides audit trail for enforcement layers 1-3**.

Logged violation types:
- `direct_implementation`: Code changes outside /implement workflow
- `git_bypass_attempt`: Attempt to bypass hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign)
- `protected_path_edit`: Edits to protected system paths

Log format (JSON Lines, one event per line):
```json
{"timestamp": "2026-01-19T12:34:56+00:00", "violation_type": "git_bypass_attempt", "agent_name": "claude", "reason": "--no-verify flag detected", "command": "git commit --no-verify -m 'bypass'"}
```

Query violations:
```python
from workflow_violation_logger import parse_violation_log, get_violation_summary

# Get all violations
entries = parse_violation_log()

# Filter by type
bypasses = parse_violation_log(violation_type_filter="git_bypass_attempt")

# Get statistics
stats = get_violation_summary()
print(stats)
# {"total_violations": 5, "by_type": {"git_bypass_attempt": 3, "protected_path_edit": 2}, "by_agent": {"claude": 5}}
```

Log rotation:
- Maximum size: 10MB per file
- Backups kept: 10 rotated files
- Format: `workflow_violations.log.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

---

## Explicit Bypass Detection (Still Active)

**Explicit bypasses in user prompts are still blocked**:
```bash
gh issue create ...  # BLOCKED - Use /create-issue
skip /create-issue   # BLOCKED - No skipping allowed
bypass /implement    # BLOCKED - No bypassing
```

**To Disable** (not recommended):
```bash
# Add to .env file
ENFORCE_WORKFLOW=false  # Disables bypass detection
```

---

## Why This is Mandatory

When `/implement` is explicitly invoked, `unified_pre_tool.py` hard-blocks coordinator code writes (Issue #528). When `/implement` is not active, the hook cannot detect intent and relies on enforcement levels (Issue #141). Either way, `/implement` is REQUIRED for code changes.

**If you skip `/implement`, you skip**:
- TDD enforcement (tests before code)
- Security scanning (OWASP audit)
- Documentation sync (doc-master agent)
- Code review (reviewer agent)
- PROJECT.md alignment validation

**The rule**: Use `/implement` for code changes. The pipeline enforces quality at every step.

---

## Example Scenario

```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Vibe coding (bypass)
User: "implement JWT authentication"
Claude: Implements directly (no PROJECT.md check, no TDD, no research)

# ✅ CORRECT: Use pipeline
User: "/create-issue Add JWT authentication"
Claude: Creates issue with research + duplicate check + cache
User: "/implement #123"
Claude: Validates alignment → TDD → implements → reviews → documents
```

## 4-Layer Consistency Architecture (Epic #142)

| Layer | % | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------|---|---------|----------------|
| **HOOKS** | 10 | Deterministic blocking | `unified_pre_tool.py`, `unified_prompt_validator.py` |
| **CLAUDE.md** | 30 | Persuasion via data | Workflow Discipline section |
| **CONVENIENCE** | 40 | Quality path easiest | `/implement` pipeline |
| **SKILLS** | 20 | Agent expertise | Native `skills:` frontmatter |

**Completed**: #140-146. **Details**: `docs/epic-142-closeout.md`

---

## Quality Reflexes (Mandatory Self-Check)

**BEFORE writing any code**, you MUST ask:

1. **Am I about to write new logic?** → If yes, STOP and use `/implement`
2. **Is this just docs/config/typo?** → If yes, proceed directly
3. **Am I unsure?** → Use `/implement` (quality-safe default)

**Why This is Required**: `/implement` runs 8 specialist agents that catch alignment, testing, security, and documentation issues. Direct implementation skips all of them.

**The Rule**: `/implement` is required for code changes. Exceptions are documented above (docs, config, typos only).
