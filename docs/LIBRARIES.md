56. **training_metrics.py** - Tulu3 multi-dimensional scoring and DPO preference generation for LLM training quality assessment (v1.0.0, Issue #279)
57. **coverage_baseline.py** - Coverage baseline storage and regression detection for test quality gates (v1.0.0, Issue #332). `check_test_count_regression(current_test_count, *, tolerance_pct=10.0, tolerance_abs=20)` blocks when test count drops by more than `min(tolerance_pct%, tolerance_abs)` from baseline, detecting test-deletion gaming where behavioral tests are replaced with fewer structural checks (Issue #711). `check_skip_regression(current_skipped)` blocks when skip count increases. `check_coverage_regression(current_coverage, tolerance=0.5)` blocks when coverage drops below baseline minus tolerance. `save_baseline(coverage_pct, skip_count, total_tests)` persists all three values atomically to `.claude/local/coverage_baseline.json`.
58. **batch_git_finalize.py** - Batch git finalization with auto-commit, merge, and worktree cleanup (v1.0.0, Issues #333-334)
59. **pipeline_intent_validator.py** - Intent-level pipeline validation via JSONL session logs for coordinator-level violations. Detects step ordering, hard gate bypasses, context dropping, parallelization violations, progressive prompt compression across batch issues (Issue #367, compression detection Issue #544), doc-master verdict timeouts/failures (Issue #543), batch issues missing continuous-improvement-analyst invocations (Issue #559), and single (non-batch) pipeline runs missing continuous-improvement-analyst invocations (Issue #667). `Finding` dataclass includes `recommended_action: Optional[str]` field for remediation guidance. `detect_progressive_compression()` accepts optional `agents_dir` parameter and populates `recommended_action` with prompt reload instructions. `get_minimum_prompt_content(agent_type, agents_dir)` reads baseline prompt content from agent `.md` files with `VALID_AGENT_TYPES` whitelist path validation (Issue #561). `detect_doc_verdict_missing()` uses `_correlate_invocation_completion()` to pair PostToolUse invocation events with SubagentStop completion events by subagent type and temporal proximity, enabling accurate verdict detection from completion word counts rather than invocation placeholders; `MIN_DOC_VERDICT_WORDS = 30` constant sets minimum output threshold (Issue #562). When correlation fails to produce a completion match (`comp is None`), a fallback scan checks whether any doc-master completion event in the full event list has `success=True` and `result_word_count >= MIN_DOC_VERDICT_WORDS`; if such an event exists the invocation is skipped as a false positive, preventing spurious `doc_verdict_missing` findings when session grouping, timestamp parsing, or time-window boundary conditions cause correlation to fail (Issue #650). `PipelineEvent` dataclass includes `session_id: str`, `total_tokens: int`, and `tool_uses: int` fields populated from JSONL log entries (token fields sourced from `session_activity_logger.py` Agent result extraction, Issue #704). `validate_pipeline_intent()` is now session-scoped: when no `session_id` filter is provided, events are grouped by their `session_id` field and each session's events are checked independently, preventing false CRITICAL `step_ordering` findings from cross-session event comparisons in a shared daily log file; legacy events with an empty `session_id` are grouped together as a fallback virtual session (Issue #587). `parse_session_logs()` accepts an optional `additional_log_paths` parameter to merge events from multiple JSONL files; duplicates are removed by `(timestamp, tool, session_id)` key before sorting. `validate_pipeline_intent()` automatically detects worktree context via `path_utils.get_main_repo_activity_log_dir()` and passes the corresponding main-repo log file as `additional_log_paths`, preventing false INCOMPLETE findings when logs are split across the worktree and its parent repository (Issue #593). `detect_doc_verdict_shallow(events)` detects doc-master completions that pass the `MIN_DOC_VERDICT_WORDS` threshold (so they evade `detect_doc_verdict_missing`) but fall below `MIN_DOC_SWEEP_WORDS = 100`; these indicate the agent likely only updated CHANGELOG without performing a semantic drift sweep. Emits `Finding` with `finding_type="doc_verdict_shallow"` and `severity="WARNING"`. Applies the same `_correlate_invocation_completion()` pairing strategy as `detect_doc_verdict_missing`, with an equivalent fallback scan when correlation produces no match. Integrated into `validate_pipeline_intent()` (Issue #672). `detect_cia_skip(events)` detects missing `continuous-improvement-analyst` in non-batch (single) pipeline runs; complements `detect_batch_cia_skip()` which handles batch runs. Skips sessions that have no completed pipeline agents (not a real pipeline run) or that look like batch runs (any event has `batch_issue_number > 0`). Emits `Finding` with `finding_type="cia_skip"`, `severity="WARNING"`, `pattern_id="single_pipeline_cia_skip"`. Integrated into `validate_pipeline_intent()` (Issue #667). `validate_step_ordering(events)` now groups agent events by `batch_issue_number` when batch events are present: ordering is checked independently within each issue group, preventing false CRITICAL findings in mixed-mode batches where `--fix` issues (implementer-only, no planner/researcher) run alongside full-pipeline issues (Issue #680). The internal helper `_validate_step_ordering_for_group(agent_events, all_events)` performs the per-group ordering check and is also called directly in non-batch mode. `detect_context_dropping(events)` now detects whether a session contains batch events and, when it does, skips consecutive-pair comparisons where `prev.batch_issue_number != curr.batch_issue_number`; this prevents false positives caused by treating the final agent result of issue N as the expected context for the first agent of issue N+1 (Issue #681).
60. **pipeline_state.py** - Pipeline state tracker with gate enforcement (stdlib only, zero dependencies) (Issue #402). HMAC integrity protection added in Issue #557: `_compute_state_hmac(state, session_id)` computes HMAC-SHA256 over critical state fields (session_start, mode, run_id, explicitly_invoked, nonce) keyed by session_id+nonce; `verify_state_hmac(state, session_id)` verifies the stored HMAC — backward compatible (returns True when no hmac field present), returns False when nonce is missing with hmac present (tampering indicator). Consumed by `unified_pre_tool.py` to reject forged pipeline state files.
61. **step5_quality_gate.py** - STEP 5 quality gate: runs tests with smart routing or full suite, checks coverage regression, enforces skip baseline, enforces test count baseline (blocks if test count drops significantly from baseline, detecting test-deletion gaming — Issue #711), reports Diamond Model tier distribution via `tier_registry.get_tier_distribution()`, and reports acceptance criteria coverage (N/M criteria covered) via `acceptance_criteria_tracker`. When total acceptance criteria > 0 but covered == 0, a WARNING is appended to the summary (never blocks). Gate passes only when all four checks pass: `test_result.passed`, `coverage_result.passed`, `skip_passed`, and `test_count_passed`. `run_quality_gate()` result dict includes `test_count_regression` key with `{passed, message}`. (Issue #508; tier reporting Issue #677; acceptance coverage Issue #676; test count regression Issue #711)
62. **test_routing.py** - Smart test routing: classifies changed files into categories and computes minimal pytest marker expression to skip irrelevant test tiers; `--full-tests` override runs complete suite (Issue #508)
63. **refactor_analyzer.py** - `RefactorAnalyzer` class: deep analysis of test shape (Quality Diamond), test waste, doc redundancy, dead code, and unused libraries; composes `SweepAnalyzer` for quick-sweep mode; `ConfidenceLevel` enum for findings; word-boundary regex to reduce false positives (Issue #513)
64. **genai_refactor_analyzer.py** - `GenAIRefactorAnalyzer`: hybrid static-candidate + LLM-semantic analysis wrapper around `RefactorAnalyzer`; three-pass analysis (doc-code drift via `covers:` frontmatter, hollow test detection, dead code verification with dynamic dispatch context); Haiku for first-pass classification, Sonnet escalation for HIGH findings; SHA-256 content hash caching; Anthropic Batch API support for 50% cost reduction (Issue #515)
65. **reviewer_benchmark.py** - Harness effectiveness benchmark for the reviewer agent: loads labeled diff datasets with ground-truth verdicts, constructs reviewer prompts, parses APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/BLOCKING verdicts, computes balanced accuracy/FPR/FNR/consistency scoring with per-difficulty and per-defect-category breakdowns, and persists reports via `skill_evaluator.BenchmarkStore`. CLI runner at `scripts/run_reviewer_benchmark.py`. Dataset expanded to 146 samples with 91-category taxonomy at `tests/benchmarks/reviewer/`. Mining scripts: `scripts/mine_git_samples.py`, `scripts/mine_session_logs.py` (Issue #567, #573)
66. **benchmark_history.py** - Append-only JSONL storage for timestamped benchmark results. `BenchmarkHistory(path)` stores one JSON object per line with timestamp, prompt hash, model, balanced accuracy, FPR, FNR, per-defect-category, per-difficulty, and confusion matrix fields. Methods: `append(report, *, prompt_hash, model, metadata)`, `load_all()` (corrupt lines silently skipped), `load_latest(n)`, `trend(metric, last_n)`. Module-level `compute_prompt_hash(prompt_text)` returns hex-encoded SHA256 of reviewer prompt for change tracking. Used by `scripts/improve_reviewer.py` to track improvement loop history. (Issue #578)
67. **reviewer_weakness_analyzer.py** - Analyzes benchmark scoring reports to identify weak defect categories and generate improvement instructions for the reviewer agent. `analyze_weaknesses(report, *, samples, taxonomy, threshold, min_samples)` returns a `WeaknessReport` with `WeaknessItem` entries sorted by priority (accuracy deficit × failure-mode weight × sample count). Failure-mode weights: `silent-failure` 1.5×, `concurrency` 1.4×, `cross-path-parity` 1.3×, `security` 1.2×. `generate_improvement_instructions(weaknesses, *, max_instructions)` produces up to N markdown instructions targeting the top weaknesses. Used by `scripts/improve_reviewer.py`. (Issue #578)
68. **runtime_data_aggregator.py** - Collect, normalize, rank, and persist improvement signals from 4 sources: session activity logs (tool failures, hook errors, agent crashes), benchmark history (per-category accuracy deficits), CI/session logs (known bypass pattern matches), and GitHub issues (auto-improvement labeled issues). `aggregate(project_root, *, window_days, top_n, repo)` collects all signals, computes priority using `SEVERITY_WEIGHTS` × severity × log(1+frequency), sorts descending, caps at top_n, persists to `.claude/logs/aggregated_reports.jsonl`, and returns `AggregatedReport`. Security: CWE-532 secret scrubbing, CWE-400 line cap (MAX_LINES=100,000), CWE-78 subprocess argument lists, CWE-22 path validation. (Issue #579)
69. **runtime_verification_classifier.py** - Classifies changed files into runtime verification categories (frontend, API, CLI) so the reviewer can perform targeted runtime checks after static code review. `classify_runtime_targets(file_paths)` returns a `RuntimeVerificationPlan` with `has_targets` flag and typed target lists (`FrontendTarget`, `ApiTarget`, `CliTarget`). Frontend detection matches `.html`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte` extensions with per-framework suggested checks. API detection matches `routes/`, `api/`, `endpoints/`, `views/` path patterns and common server filenames, guessing framework (fastapi, flask, express) from path. CLI detection matches scripts and named CLI tools. All detection excludes test files. (v1.0.0, Issue #564)
70. **retrospective_analyzer.py** - Session log analysis and drift detection for the `/retrospective` command. Reads JSONL activity logs from `.claude/logs/activity/`, groups events by session, and runs three drift detectors: `detect_repeated_corrections(summaries, *, min_threshold)` flags correction patterns (revert, wrong, stop, etc.) recurring across multiple sessions; `detect_config_drift(project_root, *, baseline_commits)` uses `git diff HEAD~N` to surface large changes to `PROJECT.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; `detect_memory_rot(memory_dir, summaries, *, decay_days)` flags date-stamped memory sections older than `decay_days` with no recent corroboration. `load_session_summaries(logs_dir, *, max_sessions)` returns `SessionSummary` dataclasses. `format_as_unified_diff(edit)` renders `ProposedEdit` objects as unified diffs. Resource limits: `MAX_SESSIONS=50`, `MAX_EVENTS_PER_SESSION=200`, `MAX_LOG_FILES=100`. Security: CWE-22 path validation, CWE-400 resource caps, CWE-116 untrusted log content. (v1.0.0, Issue #598)
71. **batch_mode_detector.py** - Per-issue pipeline mode detection for `/implement --batch --issues`. Analyzes issue title, body, and labels to automatically select the appropriate pipeline variant (full/fix/light) for each issue. `PipelineMode` enum: `FULL`, `FIX`, `LIGHT`. `ModeDetection` dataclass: `mode`, `confidence` (0.0–1.0), `signals` (list of matched signal descriptions), `source` ("label"/"title"/"body"/"default"). `detect_issue_mode(title, body, labels)` applies priority: (1) label override — "bug" → FIX, "documentation" → LIGHT at confidence 1.0; (2) signal matching — `FIX_SIGNALS` / `LIGHT_SIGNALS` with title worth 2 pts, body worth 1 pt; (3) tie-break: fix wins over light; (4) default: FULL. `detect_batch_modes(issues)` accepts a list of dicts with "title", "body", "labels" keys (labels as list of strings or GitHub API dicts). `format_mode_summary_table(issue_numbers, titles, modes)` returns a formatted text table for display. (v1.0.0, Issue #600)
72. **doc_verdict_validator.py** - Validates that doc-master output contains a properly formatted `DOC-DRIFT-VERDICT` line. `validate_doc_verdict(doc_master_output)` returns a `DocVerdictResult` dataclass with: `found` (bool), `verdict` ("PASS"/"FAIL"/""), `finding_count` (int, -1 if unparseable, 0 for PASS, N for FAIL(N)), `raw_line` (the matched verdict line), and `position_warning` (non-empty if verdict is not the final non-empty line). Strips ANSI escape codes before matching. When multiple verdict lines appear, uses the last one. `FAIL(0)` is treated as PASS. Used by the coordinator to detect missing verdicts before the pipeline completes. (v1.0.0, Issue #602)
73. **prompt_integrity.py** - Real-time prevention of progressive prompt compression in batch processing. `validate_prompt_word_count(agent_type, prompt, baseline_word_count)` checks: (1) prompt must not be empty; (2) critical agents must have at least 80 words; (3) shrinkage vs baseline must be ≤ 20% (configurable via `max_shrinkage`). Returns `PromptIntegrityResult` with `passed`, `reason`, `shrinkage_pct`, and `should_reload` fields. `record_prompt_baseline(agent_type, issue_number, word_count)` persists word counts to `.claude/logs/prompt_baselines.json`. `get_prompt_baseline(agent_type)` retrieves the word count from the lowest-numbered (first) issue. `get_agent_prompt_template(agent_type)` reads the agent's `.md` source file for prompt reconstruction. `clear_prompt_baselines()` resets state at batch start. `COMPRESSION_CRITICAL_AGENTS = {"security-auditor", "reviewer", "researcher-local", "researcher", "implementer", "planner", "doc-master"}` — mirrors the same set in `pipeline_intent_validator.py`. (v1.0.0, Issues #601, #603, #696)
74. **pipeline_timing_analyzer.py** - Automatic pipeline timing analysis for the continuous-improvement-analyst (check #11, Issue #621). Detects four finding types: `GHOST` (duration <10s, words <50), `WASTEFUL` (low words/sec over 60s), `SLOW` (exceeds static or adaptive p95×1.5 threshold), and `TOKEN_EFFICIENCY` (tokens-per-word ratio >500 — added Issue #704). `AgentTiming` dataclass includes `total_tokens` and `tool_uses` fields (populated from Agent result `<usage>` blocks via `session_activity_logger.py`). `format_timing_report()` conditionally adds `Tokens` and `Tok/Word` columns to the timing table when any invocation has token data. Adaptive thresholds computed from rolling history via `load_timing_history()` / `save_timing_entry(timings, history_path)`. `check_consecutive_violations(agent_type, history_path, threshold)` counts consecutive recent runs exceeding a threshold — used as a circuit breaker before filing GitHub issues. Per-agent time budget functions added in Issue #705: `load_time_budgets(config_path)` loads `pipeline_time_budgets.json` (falls back to `STATIC_THRESHOLDS` when file missing); `check_budget_violation(agent_type, duration_seconds, budgets)` returns `None` if within budget or a dict with `level` ("warning"/"exceeded"), `duration`, `budget`, and `pct_used`; `format_budget_warning(violation)` formats a human-readable stick+carrot message with `REQUIRED NEXT ACTION` directive. Budget config at `plugins/autonomous-dev/config/pipeline_time_budgets.json`.
75. **version_reader.py** - Lightweight plugin version + git SHA stamping for session logs and auto-filed issues (Issue #630).
76. **test_pruning_analyzer.py** - AST-based test hygiene analyzer for `/sweep --tests`. Detects 5 categories of pruning candidates: dead imports, archived references, zero-assertion tests, duplicate coverage, and stale regression references. All output is informational — never auto-deletes. (v1.0.0, Issue #674)
77. **test_issue_tracer.py** - Test-to-issue traceability library: scans test files for issue references (class names, function names, docstrings, comments, GH-NNN shorthand, pytest markers), cross-references with GitHub issues via `gh` CLI, and produces a `TracingReport` with three finding categories: untested issues, orphaned pairs, and untraced tests. Non-blocking — used by `/audit --test-tracing` and STEP 13 non-blocking warning in `/implement`. (v1.0.0, Issue #675)
78. **acceptance_criteria_tracker.py** - Tracks which acceptance criteria from STEP 6 have corresponding tests, computing N/M coverage ratios surfaced in the STEP 8 quality gate report. `save_criteria_registry(criteria, artifact_dir)` writes a JSON registry mapping each criterion to its scenario_name and test_file. `load_criteria_registry(artifact_dir)` reads the registry (returns empty list if missing or corrupt). `compute_criteria_coverage(registry, tests_dir)` scans all test files under tests_dir and returns a `CriteriaCoverageResult` dataclass with `total`, `covered`, `uncovered_criteria`, `coverage_ratio`, and `has_warning` (True when total > 0 but covered == 0). Consumed by `step5_quality_gate.run_quality_gate()`. Coverage is advisory only — never blocks the pipeline. (v1.0.0, Issue #676)

79. **test_lifecycle_manager.py** - Orchestrates existing test analyzers (TestIssueTracer, TestPruningAnalyzer, tier_registry, coverage_baseline) into a unified `TestHealthReport`. Each analyzer runs in an isolated error boundary so a single failure produces a partial report rather than a crash. `TestLifecycleManager(project_root).analyze()` returns a `TestHealthReport` with `tracing`, `pruning`, `tier_distribution`, `coverage_baseline`, `summary` (aggregated `TestHealthSummary`), `scan_duration_ms`, and `errors` fields. `format_dashboard(report)` renders a markdown health dashboard. `check_issue_tracing(project_root, issue_number)` is a pipeline convenience wrapper that returns a warning string when an issue has no test references. Used by `/improve` STEP 2.7 and by `continuous-improvement-analyst` check #12. (v1.0.0, Issue #673)

80. **skill_change_detector.py** - Detect which skills were modified in a changeset and check evaluation readiness. `detect_skill_changes(file_paths)` extracts skill names from paths matching `skills/*/SKILL.md`. `get_eval_status(skill_name, *, repo_root)` checks for eval prompts (`tests/genai/skills/eval_prompts/{name}.json`) and baseline data (`tests/genai/skills/baselines/effectiveness.json`), returning `{skill_name, has_eval_prompts, baseline, evaluable}`. `format_skill_eval_report(results)` formats per-skill results with PASS/WARNING/BLOCK verdicts (delta < -0.10 triggers BLOCK). `get_weak_skills(baselines_path, *, min_delta, min_pass_rate, stale_days)` identifies skills with weak delta, low pass rate, or stale baselines — used by `/improve` STEP 2.5 to surface skill health. Used by STEP 11.5 (Skill Effectiveness Gate) in `/implement` and by `/improve`. (v1.0.0, Issue #643)

81. **covers_index.py** - Pre-computed source-path to doc-file mapping for doc-master optimization. `build_covers_index(docs_dir)` scans all `*.md` files for `covers:` YAML frontmatter and returns a dict mapping each source path (or pattern) to the sorted list of doc files that cover it. `get_affected_docs(changed_files, index)` matches changed paths against index keys using exact match, prefix match (keys ending in `/`), and glob match (keys containing `*`), returning a deduplicated sorted list of affected doc paths. `save_covers_index(index, output_path)` writes the index as formatted JSON with `_generated` and `_doc_count` metadata keys. `load_covers_index(index_path)` reads the JSON and strips metadata keys. Eliminates doc-master's per-invocation 23-file scan; the index is pre-built by `scripts/build_covers_index.py` and stored at `docs/covers_index.json`. (v1.0.0, Issue #713)

82. **pipeline_efficiency_analyzer.py** - Cross-run pipeline efficiency analysis for the continuous-improvement-analyst (check #14, Issue #714). Analyzes historical timing data from `timing_history.jsonl` to surface agent optimization opportunities. Three analysis functions: `detect_model_tier_recommendations(agent_entries, agent_type)` flags agents with stable quality (CV < 0.3) and efficient token usage (median tokens/word < 100) as downgrade candidates, and warns on prompt bloat (tokens/word > 500); `detect_token_trends(agent_entries, agent_type)` uses simple linear regression to detect rising token usage over sequential runs (flagged when slope > 0 and R² > 0.5); `compute_iqr_outliers(values)` returns values outside the standard IQR fences (Q1 − 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR). Main entry point: `analyze_efficiency(observations, *, min_observations=5)` groups by agent_type, runs all three analyses, and returns a list of `EfficiencyFinding` dataclasses capped at 5 per report (circuit breaker). `format_efficiency_report(findings)` renders a Markdown summary. Consumes data from `load_full_timing_history()` in `pipeline_timing_analyzer.py`. Advisory only — never blocks the pipeline. (v1.0.0, Issue #714)

83. **secret_patterns.py** - Shared credential detection patterns — single source of truth for `hooks/security_scan.py` and `lib/active_security_scanner.py`. Exports `SECRET_PATTERNS` (list of `(regex_str, description)` tuples for API keys, AWS keys, generic secrets, database URLs, and private keys), `COMPILED_SECRET_PATTERNS` (pre-compiled versions for efficient reuse), `OWASP_CODE_PATTERNS` (list of `(regex_str, owasp_category, remediation)` tuples covering A03 command/code/SQL injection, A05 debug=True misconfiguration, A10 SSRF dynamic URL construction), `COMPILED_OWASP_PATTERNS`, and `DEPENDENCY_ADVISORIES` (dict of package → CVE advisory list for django, flask, requests, urllib3, cryptography, pillow, jinja2, pyyaml). (v1.0.0, Issue #710)

84. **active_security_scanner.py** - Active security scanning with three modes: dependency audit, credential history scan, and OWASP pattern scan. `dependency_audit(project_root)` parses `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`, checks versions against `DEPENDENCY_ADVISORIES`, and runs `pip-audit` when available. `credential_history_scan(project_root, *, max_commits=1000)` scans `git log --all -p` diff lines against `COMPILED_SECRET_PATTERNS`, returning `CRITICAL` findings for any leaked credentials. `owasp_pattern_scan(file_paths)` checks Python source files against `COMPILED_OWASP_PATTERNS`, skipping test files and comments to reduce false positives. `full_scan(project_root, changed_files=None)` orchestrates all three scans and returns an `ActiveScanReport` dataclass with `findings` (sorted by `Severity` enum: CRITICAL→HIGH→MEDIUM→LOW), `scan_duration`, and `scans_completed`. `format_report(report)` renders Markdown with severity summary table, findings table, and remediation actions. Used by the `security-auditor` agent at STEP 0 before passive OWASP checklist review. (v1.0.0, Issue #710)

85. **context_budget_monitor.py** - Inline truncation warnings and context budget threshold tracking (pure Python, no external dependencies). `truncate_output(text, *, max_chars=12000, tail_chars=500)` returns text unchanged if within limit; when the text exceeds `max_chars` it inserts an inline `[TRUNCATED: N chars removed. Showing first K + last T chars]` marker so downstream agents know content was cut — the head-only path activates when `tail_chars >= max_chars`. `check_context_budget(current_tokens, max_tokens, *, warn_threshold=0.80, critical_threshold=0.95)` returns `None` below the warn threshold, an advisory `[CONTEXT NOTE: X% of token budget used. Prioritize completing current task over exploration.]` string between warn and critical thresholds, and a blocking `[CONTEXT WARNING: X% of token budget used (N/M). Complete current step only.]` string at or above the critical threshold; `max_tokens <= 0` always returns a critical warning. `estimate_tokens(text)` approximates token count via `word_count * 1.3` (model-agnostic rough estimate). Constants: `DEFAULT_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS = 12000`, `DEFAULT_TAIL_CHARS = 500`, `WARN_THRESHOLD = 0.80`, `CRITICAL_THRESHOLD = 0.95`. Integrated into `implement.md` STEP 10b VERBATIM PASSING: coordinators MUST include the `[TRUNCATED: N chars removed]` marker at truncation points when passing file diffs to downstream agents. (v1.0.0, Issue #729)

86. **blocking_signal_classifier.py** - Three-tier blocking signal classification for implementer adaptive replanning (pure Python, no external dependencies). `classify_blocking_signal(error_output)` inspects raw tool output and returns a `BlockingSignal` dataclass with `signal_type` (`BlockingSignalType.RECOVERABLE`, `STRUCTURAL`, or `NOT_BLOCKING`), `error_name`, `error_detail`, and `suggested_action`. Recoverable signals (ModuleNotFoundError, FileNotFoundError, ImportError, AttributeError, command not found / exit code 127) trigger mini-replan cycles; structural signals (SyntaxError, IndentationError, TabError) indicate the code must be fixed before retrying. `sanitize_error_for_directive(error_output)` truncates to `MAX_DIRECTIVE_ERROR_LENGTH=500` chars and removes newlines, delegating to `failure_classifier.sanitize_error_message` when available. `format_mini_replan_directive(signal, *, cycle)` produces a structured `[MINI-REPLAN cycle N/2]` directive for injection into the implementer prompt, including the error name, detail, suggested action, FORBIDDEN retry clause, and a final-cycle escalation warning when `cycle >= MAX_MINI_REPLAN_CYCLES=2`. Used by the implementer agent HARD GATE (Issue #730). (v1.0.0, Issue #730)

## 70. qa_self_healer.py (16360 bytes, v1.0.0 - Issue #184)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate automatic test healing with fix iterations to resolve test failures without manual intervention.

**Problem**: When tests fail during development, engineers must manually analyze error messages, implement fixes, and re-run tests. This is repetitive and error-prone for simple issues (missing colons, typos, incorrect imports).

**Solution**: Self-healing QA orchestrator that automatically detects failures, analyzes errors, generates fixes, applies patches, and retries until all tests pass or max iterations/stuck detection reached.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/qa_self_healer.py`

**Key Features**:
- Iterative healing loop (max 10 iterations by default)
- Multi-failure handling (fix all failures in each iteration)
- Stuck detection (3 identical errors triggers circuit breaker)
- Environment variable controls (SELF_HEAL_ENABLED, SELF_HEAL_MAX_ITERATIONS)
- Audit logging for all healing attempts
- Atomic rollback on patch failure

### Classes

#### `SelfHealingResult`
Result object from healing operation with full history and outcome.

    test_dir: Optional[Path] = None,
    max_iterations: int = 10,
    enabled: bool = True,
    stuck_threshold: int = 3
)
```

Run self-healing loop to fix all test failures.

**Parameters**:
- `test_command: Optional[List[str]]` - Test command to execute (default: ["pytest"])

**Returns**: `SelfHealingResult` with outcome and full history

**Logic**:
```
Loop (max iterations):
  1. Run tests
  2. If all pass → return SUCCESS
  3. Parse failures from output
  4. Check stuck detector (3 identical errors → STOP)
  5. Generate fixes for all failures
  6. Apply fixes atomically
  7. Record attempt
  8. Repeat
```

### Functions

- Atomic writes prevent partial updates
- Backup creation for rollback

### Performance

- Iteration 1: 2-5 seconds (test run + analysis + fix)
- Subsequent iterations: 1-3 seconds each
- Typical convergence: 2-4 iterations for simple fixes
- Max iterations: 10 (configurable)
- Timeout: None (relies on underlying test runner)

### Test Coverage

- Successful healing (syntax errors, typos, missing imports)
- Stuck detection (circuit breaker)
- Max iterations reached
- Atomic rollback on patch failure
- Environment variable control

### Version History

- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with iterative healing loop (Issue #184)

## 73. stuck_detector.py (5453 bytes, v1.0.0 - Issue #184)

**Purpose**: Detect infinite healing loops from repeated identical errors to prevent wasted iterations.

**Problem**: Self-healing loop can get stuck if the same error repeats (e.g., fix doesn't address root cause). Need to detect this and stop to avoid infinite iterations.

**Solution**: Track error signatures and trigger circuit breaker when same error appears N consecutive times (default: 3).

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/stuck_detector.py`

**Key Features**:
- Error signature computation (normalized for comparison)
- Consecutive error tracking
- Configurable stuck threshold (default: 3)
- Reset on successful test run
- Thread-safe operation

### Constants

### Methods

#### `record_error(error_signature)`

**Parameters**: None

#### `compute_error_signature(failures)`

Compute normalized error signature from failures.

**Parameters**:
- `failures: List[FailureAnalysis]` - Parsed test failures

### Functions

#### `is_stuck()`

Check global stuck status (singleton).

**Returns**: `bool` - True if stuck

#### `reset_stuck_detection()`

Reset global stuck detector (singleton).

**Parameters**: None

### Stuck Detection Logic

1. Compute error signature (file + line + error type)
2. Compare with previous errors
3. If same signature appears N times consecutively -> STUCK
4. Otherwise -> continue healing
5. On test success -> reset detector

### Design Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: Global stuck detector instance
- **Signature Normalization**: Ignore message text, focus on error location/type
- **Bounded Memory**: Only store recent error history
- **Thread-safe**: Uses locks for concurrent access

### Integration Points

**qa_self_healer.py**: Uses to check for stuck loops before continuing iterations

**Other Libraries**:
- Works with `failure_analyzer.py` for error signatures

### Security

- No code execution
- Bounded memory (only stores recent signatures)
- Thread-safe with locks
- No credential exposure

### Performance

- record_error(): <0.1ms
- is_stuck(): <0.1ms
- reset(): <0.1ms
- compute_error_signature(): <1ms
- Memory usage: O(n) where n = max_history

### Test Coverage

- Error signature computation
- Consecutive error tracking
- Circuit breaker threshold
- Reset on success
- Thread safety
- Edge cases: Empty signature, rapid errors

### Version History

- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with circuit breaker threshold (Issue #184)

### Backward Compatibility

N/A (new library - Issue #184)

  - Wraps commands in nested `hooks` array if missing
  - Adds `matcher: '*'` if missing
  - Preserves user customizations (custom timeouts, matchers)
- **Idempotent**: Running multiple times produces same result
- **Example**:
  ```python
  legacy = {"hooks": {"PrePush": ["auto_test.py"]}}
  modern = migrate_hook_format_cc2(legacy)
  # Result: modern['hooks']['PrePush'][0]['hooks'][0]['timeout'] == 5
  ```

#### migrate_hooks_to_object_format(settings_path) (NEW - Issue #135)
- **Purpose**: Auto-migrate hooks from array format to object format during /sync --marketplace (Claude Code v2.0.69+ compatibility)
- **Parameters**:
  - settings_path (Path): Path to settings.json (typically user home/.claude/settings.json)
- **Returns**: Dict with keys:
  - migrated (bool): True if migration was performed
  - backup_path (Optional[Path]): Path to timestamped backup if migrated
  - format (str): Detected format - array (needs migration), object (already modern), invalid, or missing
  - error (Optional[str]): Error message if migration failed
- **Format Detection**:
  - **Array format** (pre-v2.0.69): Array of hook objects with event and command fields
  - **Object format** (v2.0.69+): Object keyed by event name with nested matcher and hooks arrays
- **Migration Steps**:
  1. Check if file exists (returns format: missing if not)
  2. Read and parse JSON (graceful error handling for corrupted files)
  3. Detect format (array vs object)
  4. If array format: Create timestamped backup, transform array to object structure, write atomically (tempfile + rename), return success with backup path
  5. If migration fails: Rollback from backup (no partial migrations)
- **Security** (CWE-22, CWE-362, CWE-404 prevention):
  - Path validation (settings must be in user home/.claude/)
  - Atomic writes prevent corruption
  - Backup creation before modifications
  - No secrets exposed in logs
  - Full rollback on error
- **Integration**: Called automatically during /sync --marketplace after settings merge
- **Non-blocking**: Migration failures do not stop sync (graceful degradation)

### Security
- Path validation via security_utils
- Audit logging to logs/security_audit.log
- Secure permissions (0o600)
- Backup creation before format migration

### Error Handling
- Non-blocking (activation failures do not block plugin update)
- Graceful degradation if migration fails (existing settings preserved)

### Format Migration (Issue #112 and Issue #135)
- **Issue #112**: Automatic migration during activate_hooks() if legacy format detected
- **Issue #135**: Automatic migration during /sync --marketplace for user settings
- **Transparent**: Backup created before any changes
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Backwards Compatible**: Legacy settings continue to work unchanged

### Test Coverage
- 41 unit tests (first install, updates, merge logic, error cases, malformed JSON)
- 28 migration tests (format detection, legacy-to-CC2 conversion, backup creation)
- 12 tests for Issue #135 migration (array-to-object format, backup creation, rollback)

### Used By
- plugin_updater.py for /update-plugin command
- activate_hooks() for automatic format migration during install/update
- sync_dispatcher.py for /sync --marketplace command (Issue #135)

## 12. abstract_state_manager.py (428 lines, NEW v1.0.0, Issue #220)

**Purpose**: Abstract Base Class (ABC) for standardized state management across all state managers.

**Problem**: Multiple state managers (batch_state_manager, session_tracker state management) had duplicate implementations of:
- Path validation and security checks (CWE-22 path traversal, CWE-59 symlinks)
- Atomic file writes with temp file + rename
- File locking for thread safety
- Audit logging for security events

**Solution**: StateManager ABC defines the contract for state management with concrete helper methods for security and atomicity.

**Note (Issue #221)**: BatchStateManager now inherits from StateManager[BatchState] to implement standardized state management interface while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Abstract Methods (must be implemented by subclasses)

#### `load_state() -> T`
- **Purpose**: Load state from persistent storage
- **Returns**: State object of type T
- **Raises**: StateError if load fails

#### `save_state(state: T) -> None`
- **Purpose**: Save state to persistent storage
- **Parameters**: `state` - State object to save
- **Raises**: StateError if save fails

#### `cleanup_state() -> None`
- **Purpose**: Clean up state (remove files, etc.)
- **Raises**: StateError if cleanup fails

### Concrete Helper Methods

#### `exists() -> bool`
- **Purpose**: Check if state file exists
- **Returns**: True if state file exists, False otherwise

#### `__repr__() -> str`
- **Purpose**: Return developer-friendly string representation
- **Returns**: String in format `ClassName(state_file=/path)` if state_file exists, otherwise `ClassName()`
- **Example**: `BatchStateManager(state_file=/tmp/batch_state.json)`

#### `_validate_state_path(path: Path) -> Path`
- **Purpose**: Validate state file path for security
- **Security**:
  - CWE-22 (Path Traversal): Prevents `../` sequences
  - CWE-59 (Symlink Following): Detects and rejects symlinks
- **Parameters**: `path` - Path to validate
- **Returns**: Resolved, validated path
- **Raises**: ValueError if path is invalid

#### `_atomic_write(path: Path, content: str, mode: int = 0o600) -> None`
- **Purpose**: Write file atomically with permissions
- **Security**:
  - CWE-367 (Race Condition): Temp file + atomic rename
  - CWE-732 (File Permissions): Sets file to read-only (0o600)
- **Parameters**:
  - `path` - File to write
  - `content` - Content to write
  - `mode` - File permissions (default: 0o600)
- **Raises**: IOError if write fails

#### `_get_file_lock(path: Path) -> threading.RLock`
- **Purpose**: Get reentrant lock for thread-safe file access
- **Parameters**: `path` - File path
- **Returns**: Reentrant lock for the file
- **Thread Safety**: Multiple threads can acquire the same lock

#### `_audit_operation(operation: str, status: str, details: Dict[str, Any]) -> None`
- **Purpose**: Log security-relevant operations
- **Parameters**:
  - `operation` - Operation type (e.g., "state_save")
  - `status` - Result status ("success", "failure", "warning")
  - `details` - Context details for audit log

### Usage Pattern

```python
from abc import ABC, TypeVar
from pathlib import Path
from abstract_state_manager import StateManager

T = TypeVar('T')  # Generic state type

class MyState:
    """Your state data class."""
    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        ...

class MyStateManager(StateManager[MyState]):
    """Custom state manager inheriting from StateManager ABC."""

    def __init__(self, state_file: Path = None):
        self.state_file = state_file or Path(".my_state.json")
        # Validate path using inherited helper
        self.state_file = self._validate_state_path(self.state_file)

    def load_state(self) -> MyState:
        """Load state from file."""
        # Use inherited helpers as needed
        if not self.exists():
            raise StateError("State file not found")
        # ... load logic ...
        return MyState(...)

    def save_state(self, state: MyState) -> None:
        """Save state to file using atomic write."""
        content = json.dumps(state.to_dict())
        # Use inherited _atomic_write for security
        self._atomic_write(self.state_file, content)
        # Log the operation
        self._audit_operation("state_save", "success", {...})

    def cleanup_state(self) -> None:
        """Clean up state file."""
        if self.exists():
            self.state_file.unlink()
```

### Security Features

1. **CWE-22 (Path Traversal Prevention)**:
   - Validates paths don't contain `../` sequences
   - Resolves symlinks and detects traversal

2. **CWE-59 (Symlink Following Prevention)**:
   - Detects and rejects symlinks
   - Prevents TOCTOU (Time-of-check-time-of-use) races

3. **CWE-367 (Atomic Write)**:
   - Writes to temp file first
   - Atomically renames to final location
   - Prevents partial/corrupted state files

4. **CWE-732 (File Permissions)**:
   - Sets files to 0o600 (user read/write only)
   - Prevents unauthorized access

### Design Notes

- **Generic type**: StateManager[T] supports any state data class
- **Delegation pattern**: Subclasses implement abstract methods, use helpers for security
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing managers can inherit without refactoring
- **Phase-based migration**: Issue #220 (ABC foundation), Issue #221 (BatchStateManager), further phases for other managers

- **Backward Compatibility**: Old state files load with defaults (issue_numbers=None, source_type="file")

#### `update_batch_progress(state, feature_index, status="completed", error=None)`
- **Purpose**: Update batch progress after feature completion
- **Parameters**:
  - `state` (BatchState): Current state
  - `feature_index` (int): Index of completed feature
  - `status` (str): "completed" or "failed"
  - `error` (Optional[str]): Error message if failed
- **Returns**: Updated BatchState object

#### `record_auto_clear_event(state, tokens_before)`
- **Purpose**: Record auto-clear event in state
- **Parameters**:
  - `state` (BatchState): Current state
  - `tokens_before` (int): Token count before clearing
- **Returns**: Updated BatchState object

#### `should_auto_clear(state, checkpoint_callback=None)` **[DEPRECATED]**
- **Status**: DEPRECATED (Issue #277) - Not used in production
- **Purpose**: Check if context should be auto-cleared (legacy function)
- **Parameters**:
  - `state` (BatchState): Current state
  - `checkpoint_callback` (callable, optional): Callback to invoke before clearing (Issue #276)
- **Returns**: bool (True if context token estimate exceeds 185K threshold)
- **Deprecation Note**: This function is not used in production. Claude Code handles auto-compact automatically. The batch system now relies on:
  - Checkpoint after every feature (Issue #276)
  - Claude's automatic compaction (whenever it decides)
  - SessionStart hook auto-resume (Issue #277)
- **Kept For**: Backward compatibility with existing tests only

#### `get_next_pending_feature(state)`
- **Purpose**: Get next feature to process
- **Parameters**: `state` (BatchState): Current state
- **Returns**: Optional[Tuple[int, str]] (index, feature description) or None if complete

#### `cleanup_batch_state(state_file)`
- **Purpose**: Delete state file after successful batch completion
- **Parameters**: `state_file` (Path): Path to state file
- **Returns**: None

#### `mark_feature_skipped(state_file, feature_index, reason, category="quality_gate")` (NEW v3.48.0, Issue #256)
- **Purpose**: Mark a feature as permanently skipped (excluded from batch processing and retries)
- **Parameters**:
  - `state_file` (Path): Path to batch state file
  - `feature_index` (int): Index of feature to skip
  - `reason` (str): Reason for skipping (user-visible message)
  - `category` (str): Skip category - "quality_gate" (default), "manual", or "dependency"
- **Returns**: None
- **Raises**: `BatchStateError` if feature_index invalid, `ValueError` if feature_index out of range
- **Thread-safe**: Uses file locking consistent with mark_feature_status()
- **Use Cases**:
  - Quality gate failures: Skip feature after exhausting max retries
  - Security audit failures: Skip feature that failed security checks
  - Manual exclusions: Skip features explicitly excluded by user
  - Dependency issues: Skip features with unsolvable dependency chains
- **Example**:
```python
from batch_state_manager import mark_feature_skipped
from path_utils import get_batch_state_file

# Skip feature due to quality gate failure
mark_feature_skipped(
    get_batch_state_file(),
    feature_index=2,
    reason="Failed security audit - CWE-79 vulnerability detected",
    category="quality_gate"
)

# Skip feature due to manual request
mark_feature_skipped(
    get_batch_state_file(),
    feature_index=5,
    reason="User requested skip - deferring to next batch",
    category="manual"
)
```

### Security Features

1. **CWE-22 (Path Traversal Prevention)**: All paths validated via security_utils.validate_path()
2. **CWE-59 (Symlink Resolution)**: Symlink detection before file operations
3. **CWE-117 (Log Injection Prevention)**: Sanitize all log messages
4. **CWE-732 (File Permissions)**: State files created with 0o600 permissions
5. **Thread Safety**: Reentrant file locks for concurrent access protection
6. **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents corrupted state

### Integration

- **Command**: `/implement --batch` (file-based and --issues flag)
- **State File**: `.claude/batch_state.json` (persistent across crashes)
- **Related**: GitHub Issues #76 (state management), #77 (--issues flag)

### Enhanced Fields (v3.24.0)

```python
@dataclass
class BatchState:
    # ... existing fields ...
    issue_numbers: Optional[List[int]] = None  # NEW: GitHub issue numbers
    source_type: str = "file"  # NEW: "file" or "issues"
```

**Backward Compatibility**: Old state files (v3.23.0) load with default values:
- `issue_numbers = None`
- `source_type = "file"`

### Object-Oriented Interface (NEW Issue #221)

#### `BatchStateManager` class (inherits from StateManager[BatchState])

Object-oriented wrapper for batch state functions that inherits from StateManager ABC.

**Constructors**:
- `__init__(state_file: Optional[Path] = None)` - Initialize with optional custom state file path

**Methods** (implementing StateManager ABC):
- `load_state() -> BatchState` - Load batch state from file
- `save_state(state: BatchState) -> None` - Save batch state to file (uses inherited _atomic_write())
- `cleanup_state() -> None` - Clean up state file

**Methods** (batch-specific operations):
- `create_batch_state(features, batch_id=None, issue_numbers=None) -> BatchState` - Create new batch state
- `create_batch(features, features_file=None, batch_id=None, issue_numbers=None) -> BatchState` - Alias for create_batch_state
- `load_batch_state() -> BatchState` - Load batch state (delegates to load_state)
- `save_batch_state(state) -> None` - Save batch state (delegates to save_state)
- `update_batch_progress(feature_index, status, tokens_consumed=0) -> None` - Update batch progress
- `record_auto_clear_event(feature_index, tokens_before) -> None` - Record auto-clear event
- `should_auto_clear(checkpoint_callback=None) -> bool` - **[DEPRECATED]** Check if auto-clear threshold exceeded (not used in production)
- `get_next_pending_feature() -> Optional[str]` - Get next unprocessed feature
- `cleanup_batch_state() -> None` - Cleanup batch (delegates to cleanup_state)

**Example**:
```python
from batch_state_manager import BatchStateManager

# Create manager
manager = BatchStateManager()

# Create new batch
state = manager.create_batch_state(
    features=["Add login", "Add logout"],
    issue_numbers=[72, 73],
)

# Save state
manager.save_batch_state(state)

# Load state
loaded_state = manager.load_batch_state()

# Update progress
manager.update_batch_progress(0, "completed", tokens_consumed=50000)

# Get next feature to process
next_feature = manager.get_next_pending_feature()

# Note: should_auto_clear() is deprecated (Issue #277)
# Claude handles auto-compact automatically - no manual checking needed

# Cleanup when done
manager.cleanup_batch_state()
```

**Inheritance Pattern**:
BatchStateManager now inherits from StateManager[BatchState] ABC (Issue #221), implementing abstract methods via delegation:
- `load_state()` delegates to `load_batch_state()`
- `save_state()` delegates to `save_batch_state()`
- `cleanup_state()` delegates to `cleanup_batch_state()`

This maintains full backward compatibility while providing standardized state management interface with built-in security helpers from StateManager ABC.

## 15. path_utils.py (350+ lines, v3.28.0+ / v3.41.0+ / v3.45.0+)

**Purpose**: Dynamic PROJECT_ROOT detection, path resolution, policy file location, and worktree batch state isolation for tracking infrastructure and tool configuration

**Issues**: GitHub #79 (hardcoded paths), GitHub #226 (worktree isolation)

### Key Features

- **Dynamic PROJECT_ROOT Detection**: Searches upward from current directory for `.git/` or `.claude/` markers
- **Worktree Batch State Isolation** (v3.45.0): Automatically isolates batch state per git worktree for concurrent batch processing
- **Caching**: Module-level cache prevents repeated filesystem searches
- **Flexible Creation**: Creates directories (docs/sessions, .claude) as needed with safe permissions (0o755)
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing usage patterns still work, uses get_project_root() internally
- **Security Validation**: Rejects symlinks and invalid JSON in policy files (CWE-59)

### Public API

#### `find_project_root(marker_files=None, start_path=None)`
- **Purpose**: Search upward for project root directory
- **Parameters**:
  - `marker_files` (list): Files/directories to search for. Defaults to `[".git", ".claude"]` (priority order)
  - `start_path` (Path): Starting directory for search. Defaults to current working directory
- **Returns**: `Path` - Project root directory
- **Raises**: `FileNotFoundError` - If no marker found up to filesystem root
- **Priority Strategy**: Searches all the way up for `.git` before considering `.claude` (ensures nested `.claude` dirs work correctly)

#### `get_project_root(use_cache=True)`
- **Purpose**: Get cached project root (detects and caches if first call)
- **Parameters**: `use_cache` (bool): Use cached value or force re-detection (default: True)
- **Returns**: `Path` - Project root directory
- **Thread Safety**: Not thread-safe (uses module-level cache); wrap with threading.Lock for multi-threading
- **Best For**: Performance-critical code that calls repeatedly

#### `get_session_dir(create=True, use_cache=True)`
- **Purpose**: Get session directory path (`PROJECT_ROOT/docs/sessions`)
- **Parameters**:
  - `create` (bool): Create directory if missing (default: True)
  - `use_cache` (bool): Use cached project root (default: True)
- **Returns**: `Path` - Session directory
- **Creates**: Parent directories with safe permissions (0o755 = rwxr-xr-x)
- **Used By**: session_tracker.py, agent_tracker.py

#### `get_batch_state_file()` (Enhanced v3.45.0 - Issue #226)
- **Purpose**: Get batch state file path with automatic worktree isolation support
- **Behavior**:
  - **Worktrees**: Returns `WORKTREE_DIR/.claude/batch_state.json` (isolated per worktree)
  - **Main Repository**: Returns `PROJECT_ROOT/.claude/batch_state.json` (backward compatible)
- **Detection**: Automatically calls `is_worktree()` to detect current directory
- **Returns**: `Path` - Batch state file path (note: file itself not created)
- **Creates**: Parent directory (`.claude/`) if missing, with safe permissions (0o755)
- **Fallback**: If worktree detection fails, falls back to main repo behavior
- **Used By**: batch_state_manager.py
- **Security**: Graceful fallback on detection errors, CWE-22 (path traversal), CWE-59 (symlinks) protection

#### `get_policy_file(use_cache=True)` (NEW in v3.41.0)
- **Purpose**: Get policy file path via cascading lookup with fallback
- **Parameters**: `use_cache` (bool): Use cached value or force re-detection (default: True). Set to False in tests that change working directory.
- **Returns**: `Path` - Policy file (validated and readable)
- **Cascading Lookup Order**:
  1. `.claude/config/auto_approve_policy.json` (project-local) - enables per-project customization
  2. `plugins/autonomous-dev/config/auto_approve_policy.json` (plugin default) - stable fallback
  3. Minimal fallback path (may not exist) - graceful degradation
- **Security Validations**:
  - Rejects symlinks (CWE-59)
  - Prevents path traversal (CWE-22)
  - Validates JSON format
  - Handles permission errors gracefully
- **Thread Safety**: Not thread-safe (uses module-level cache); wrap with threading.Lock for multi-threading
- **Used By**: tool_validator.py, auto_approval_engine.py
- **Use Cases**:
  - Customize policy per project (place policy in `.claude/config/auto_approve_policy.json`)
  - Inherit plugin defaults (omit custom policy)
  - Test with different policies (call with `use_cache=False`)

#### `is_worktree()` (NEW in v3.45.0 - Issue #226)
- **Purpose**: Check if current directory is a git worktree (lazy-loaded wrapper)
- **Returns**: `bool` - True if in worktree, False otherwise
- **Lazy Import**: Imports git_operations.is_worktree() on first call to avoid circular dependencies
- **Fallback**: Returns False if import fails or detection raises exception
- **Used By**: get_batch_state_file(), get_main_repo_activity_log_dir()
- **Caching**: Module-level function cache for performance
- **Testing**: Can be mocked by patching `path_utils.is_worktree`

#### `get_main_repo_activity_log_dir()` (NEW - Issue #593)
- **Purpose**: Get the activity log directory of the main (parent) repository when running inside a git worktree
- **Returns**: `Optional[Path]` - Path to `<parent_repo>/.claude/logs/activity/` if in a worktree and the directory exists; `None` otherwise
- **Behavior**: Returns `None` immediately when not in a worktree; resolves parent repo path via `git_operations.get_worktree_parent()`
- **Used By**: `pipeline_intent_validator.validate_pipeline_intent()` to merge main repo logs and prevent false INCOMPLETE findings in worktree context
- **Fallback**: Returns `None` if worktree detection fails, parent resolution fails, or the activity directory does not exist

#### `reset_project_root_cache()`
- **Purpose**: Reset cached project root (testing only)
- **Warning**: Only use in test teardown; production code should maintain cache for process lifetime

#### `reset_worktree_cache()` (NEW in v3.45.0 - Issue #226)
- **Purpose**: Reset cached is_worktree function (testing only)
- **Warning**: Only use in test teardown; production code should maintain cache for process lifetime

### Test Coverage

- **Total**: 45+ tests in `tests/unit/test_tracking_path_resolution.py` + 15 tests in `tests/unit/lib/test_policy_path_resolution.py` + 15 tests in `tests/unit/lib/test_path_utils_worktree.py` + 9 integration tests in `tests/integration/test_worktree_batch_isolation.py` (NEW v3.45.0) + 9 tests in `tests/unit/lib/test_worktree_log_resolution.py` (Issue #593)
- **Areas**:
  - PROJECT_ROOT detection from various directories
  - Marker file priority (`.git` over `.claude`)
  - Nested `.claude/` handling in git repositories
  - Directory creation with safe permissions
  - Cache behavior and reset
  - Policy file cascading lookup (NEW v3.41.0)
  - Policy file security validation (NEW v3.41.0)
  - Symlink detection in policy files (NEW v3.41.0)
  - Worktree batch state path isolation (NEW v3.45.0 - Issue #226)
  - Concurrent worktree batch operations (NEW v3.45.0)
  - Worktree detection fallback behavior (NEW v3.45.0)
  - Real git worktree integration (NEW v3.45.0)

### Worktree Safety Pattern (NEW in Issues #313-316)

**Critical for Batch Processing**: All libraries must use `get_project_root()` for absolute path resolution to work correctly in worktree-based batch processing.

```python
from path_utils import get_project_root

# BROKEN (Issue #313 - hardcoded relative path)
plugins_dir = "plugins/autonomous-dev"  # Fails in worktrees
config_file = ".claude/settings.json"   # Fails in worktrees

# FIXED (Issue #313 - absolute path via get_project_root())
plugins_dir = get_project_root() / "plugins/autonomous-dev"  # Works in worktrees
config_file = get_project_root() / ".claude/settings.json"   # Works in worktrees
```

**Files Using This Pattern** (Issue #313):
- brownfield_retrofit.py: Dynamic get_project_root() for plugins/ references
- orphan_file_cleaner.py: get_project_root() for plugins directory
- settings_generator.py: get_project_root() for plugins directory
- test_session_state_manager.py: get_project_root() for .claude/ directory
- test_agent_tracker.py: get_project_root() for docs/sessions directory

**Security**: Fixes CWE-22 (Path Traversal) by validating all paths relative to dynamically detected project root.

### Usage Examples

```python
from plugins.autonomous_dev.lib.path_utils import (
    get_project_root,
    get_session_dir,
    get_batch_state_file,
    get_policy_file
)

# Get project root (cached after first call)
root = get_project_root()
print(root)  # /path/to/autonomous-dev

# Get session directory (creates if missing)
session_dir = get_session_dir()
session_file = session_dir / "20251117-session.md"

# Get batch state file path (with worktree isolation - v3.45.0)
state_file = get_batch_state_file()
# Main repo: Returns /project/.claude/batch_state.json
# In worktree: Returns /project/worktree-dir/.claude/batch_state.json

# Check if in worktree (v3.45.0)
from plugins.autonomous_dev.lib.path_utils import is_worktree
if is_worktree():
    print("Running in git worktree - batch state isolated")
else:
    print("Running in main repository")

# Get policy file with cascading lookup
policy_file = get_policy_file()
# 1. Tries: .claude/config/auto_approve_policy.json (project-local)
# 2. Falls back to: plugins/autonomous-dev/config/auto_approve_policy.json (plugin default)
# 3. Returns minimal fallback if both missing

# Force re-detection (for tests that change cwd)
from tests.conftest import isolated_project
root = get_project_root(use_cache=False)
policy_file = get_policy_file(use_cache=False)

# Worktree example (v3.45.0)
# In main repo
state_file = get_batch_state_file()  # .claude/batch_state.json

# In worktree
state_file = get_batch_state_file()  # worktree-dir/.claude/batch_state.json (isolated)
```

### Security

- **No Path Traversal**: Only searches upward, never downward
- **Safe Permissions**: Creates directories with 0o755 (rwxr-xr-x)
- **Validation**: Validates marker files exist before returning
- **Symlink Handling**: Resolves symlinks to canonical paths
- **Policy File Security** (v3.41.0):
  - Rejects symlinks in policy file locations (CWE-59)
  - Validates JSON format before use (prevents malformed policy)
  - Handles permission denied errors gracefully
  - Prefers project-local customization for per-project policies

### Migration from Hardcoded Paths

**Before** (Issue #79 - fails from subdirectories):
```python
# Hardcoded path in session_tracker.py line 25
session_dir = Path("docs/sessions")  # Fails if cwd != project root
```

**After** (v3.28.0+):
```python
from path_utils import get_session_dir
session_dir = get_session_dir()  # Works from any subdirectory
```

### Policy File Customization (NEW in v3.41.0)

Per-project policy customization enables different auto-approval policies for different projects:

**Project-Local Policy** (takes priority):
```bash
# Create custom policy in your project
mkdir -p .claude/config/
cp plugins/autonomous-dev/config/auto_approve_policy.json .claude/config/auto_approve_policy.json
# Edit .claude/config/auto_approve_policy.json for project-specific rules
```

**Automatic Fallback**:
```python
# Code automatically uses:
# 1. .claude/config/auto_approve_policy.json (if it exists and is valid)
# 2. plugins/autonomous-dev/config/auto_approve_policy.json (plugin default)
policy_file = get_policy_file()  # No configuration needed!
```

```python
from plugins.autonomous_dev.lib.validation import (
    validate_session_path,
    validate_agent_name,
    validate_message
)

# Validate session path
try:
    safe_path = validate_session_path("/project/docs/sessions/file.json")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid path: {e}")

# Validate agent name
try:
    name = validate_agent_name("researcher-v2")
    print(f"Valid name: {name}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid name: {e}")

# Validate message
try:
    msg = validate_message("Research complete - 5 patterns found")
    print(f"Valid message: {msg}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid message: {e}")

# Security: These raise ValueError
validate_session_path("../../etc/passwd")  # Path traversal
validate_session_path("/etc/passwd")  # Outside allowed dirs
validate_agent_name("../../etc/passwd")  # Invalid chars
validate_agent_name("")  # Empty
validate_message("x" * 20000)  # Too long

- **Fail Closed**: Reject unknown inputs (not permissive)
- **Clear Errors**: Error messages guide developers to correct usage
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers prevent bypasses
- **No Eval/Exec**: Pure validation, no code execution

  3. Default to PERMANENT for safety (unknown errors not retried)
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  classify_failure("ConnectionError: Failed to connect")  # TRANSIENT
  classify_failure("SyntaxError: invalid syntax")  # PERMANENT
  classify_failure("WeirdUnknownError")  # PERMANENT (safe default)

- **Examples**:
  ```python
  sanitize_error_message("Error\nFAKE LOG: Admin")  # "Error FAKE LOG: Admin"
  sanitize_error_message("E" * 10000)  # "EEEE...[truncated]"
  ```

  2. Check circuit breaker (5 consecutive failures)
  3. Check failure type (permanent → no retry)
  4. Check per-feature limit (max 3 retries)
  5. If all pass → allow retry
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  manager = BatchRetryManager("batch-123")
  decision = manager.should_retry_feature(0, FailureType.TRANSIENT)
  if decision.should_retry:
      # Retry feature...
  ```

- **Side Effects**:
  - Resets consecutive failure count (circuit breaker reset)
  - Saves state atomically

###### `check_circuit_breaker()`
- **Purpose**: Check if circuit breaker is open
- **Returns**: `True` if open (retries blocked), `False` otherwise

###### `reset_circuit_breaker()`
- **Purpose**: Manually reset circuit breaker after investigation

### Constants

- `MAX_RETRIES_PER_FEATURE = 3`: Max retries per feature
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 5`: Consecutive failures to open circuit
- `MAX_TOTAL_RETRIES = 50`: Global retry limit across batch

### Convenience Functions

Module provides standalone functions for quick use without class:

- `should_retry_feature(batch_id, feature_index, failure_type, state_dir)` - Check if retry allowed
- `record_retry_attempt(batch_id, feature_index, error_message, state_dir)` - Record attempt
- `check_circuit_breaker(batch_id, state_dir)` - Check breaker status
- `get_retry_count(batch_id, feature_index, state_dir)` - Get retry count
- `reset_circuit_breaker(batch_id, state_dir)` - Reset breaker

### State Persistence

Retry state saved to `.claude/batch_*_retry_state.json`:

```json
{
  "batch_id": "batch-20251118-123456",
  "retry_counts": { "0": 2, "5": 1 },
  "global_retry_count": 5,
  "consecutive_failures": 0,
  "circuit_breaker_open": false,
  "created_at": "2025-11-19T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-11-19T10:15:00Z"
}
```

State file uses atomic writes (tempfile + rename) for crash safety.

### Audit Logging

All retry attempts logged to `.claude/audit/batch_*_retry_audit.jsonl` with entries:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-19T10:00:00Z",
  "event_type": "retry_attempt",
  "batch_id": "batch-123",
  "feature_index": 0,
  "retry_count": 1,
  "global_retry_count": 5,
  "error_message": "ConnectionError: Failed"
}
```

### Security
- Atomic writes (temp file + rename)
- Path validation for state directories
- Error message sanitization (CWE-117)
- Circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion
- Audit logging for all decisions

### Test Coverage
- 40+ unit tests covering:
  - Retry decision logic (all 5 checks)
  - State persistence (load/save)
  - Circuit breaker (open/close/reset)
  - Consecutive failure tracking
  - Edge cases (corrupted state, missing files)

## 23. batch_retry_consent.py (360 lines, v3.33.0+)

**Purpose**: First-run consent prompt and persistent state for automatic retry feature.

### Overview

Interactive consent system for /implement --batch automatic retry:
- First-run prompt (explains feature, safety limits)
- Persistent state storage (`~/.autonomous-dev/user_state.json`)
- Environment variable override (`BATCH_RETRY_ENABLED`)
- Secure file permissions (0o600 user-only)
- Path validation (prevent symlink attacks)

### Constants

- `DEFAULT_USER_STATE_FILE = ~/.autonomous-dev/user_state.json`: Default state location
- `ENV_VAR_BATCH_RETRY = "BATCH_RETRY_ENABLED"`: Environment variable name

### Main Functions

#### `check_retry_consent()`
- **Purpose**: Check if user has consented to automatic retry
- **Workflow**:
  1. Check if already set in state file
  2. If not set, prompt user
  3. Save response to state file
  4. Return response
- **Returns**: `True` if enabled, `False` if disabled
- **First Run**: Displays consent prompt, saves choice to `~/.autonomous-dev/user_state.json`
- **Subsequent Runs**: Reads from state file (no prompt)

#### `is_retry_enabled()`
- **Purpose**: Check if automatic retry is enabled
- **Priority Order**:
  1. Check environment variable `BATCH_RETRY_ENABLED` (highest priority)
  2. Check user state file `~/.autonomous-dev/user_state.json`
  3. Prompt user if not set (with check_retry_consent)
- **Returns**: `True` if enabled, `False` if disabled
- **Examples**:
  ```python
  # Environment variable overrides state file
  os.environ["BATCH_RETRY_ENABLED"] = "false"
  is_retry_enabled()  # False (env var checked first)

  # Fall back to state file if env var not set
  os.environ.pop("BATCH_RETRY_ENABLED", None)
  is_retry_enabled()  # Reads from state file or prompts
  ```

#### `prompt_for_retry_consent()`
- **Purpose**: Display first-run consent prompt and get user response
- **Returns**: `True` if user consented (yes/y/Y/Enter), `False` otherwise
- **Prompt Displays**:
  - Automatic retry feature explanation
  - Types of errors retried (network, timeout, rate limit)
  - Max 3 retries per feature
  - Circuit breaker after 5 consecutive failures
  - How to disable via `.env` file
- **Default Behavior**: Enter/no response → False (conservative default)

### State File Management

#### `save_consent_state(retry_enabled)`
- **Purpose**: Save consent decision to state file
- **Parameters**: `retry_enabled` (bool): Whether retry is enabled
- **Features**:
  - Creates directory if needed: `~/.autonomous-dev/`
  - Sets file permissions to 0o600 (user-only read/write)
  - Atomic write (tempfile + rename)
  - Preserves existing state (merges with existing keys)

#### `load_consent_state()`
- **Purpose**: Load saved consent decision
- **Returns**: `True` if enabled, `False` if disabled, `None` if not set
- **Security**: Rejects symlinks (CWE-59 prevention)
- **Graceful**: Returns `None` if file corrupted or missing

#### `get_user_state_file()`
- **Purpose**: Get path to user state file
- **Returns**: `Path` object pointing to `~/.autonomous-dev/user_state.json`
- **Note**: Can be overridden for testing

### Exceptions

#### `ConsentError`
- **Purpose**: Exception for consent-related errors
- **Raised When**:
  - User state file is a symlink (CWE-59)
  - Cannot write to user state directory
  - File corruption prevents parsing

### Security

- **CWE-22**: Path validation (rejects traversal attempts)
- **CWE-59**: Symlink rejection for user state file (prevents symlink attacks)
- **CWE-732**: File permissions secured to 0o600 (user-only read/write)
- **Atomic Writes**: Temp file + rename prevents partial writes

### State File Format

User state stored in `~/.autonomous-dev/user_state.json`:

## 24. quality_persistence_enforcer.py (450+ lines, v1.0.0, Issue #254)

**Purpose**: Central enforcement engine for quality gates in batch workflows ensuring features pass all quality requirements before completion.

### Overview

Quality persistence enforcer prevents batches from giving up too easily or faking success when tests fail. System enforces:
- **100% test pass requirement** (not 80%, not "most" - ALL tests must pass)
- **Coverage threshold** (80%+ code coverage)
- **Retry limits** (max 3 attempts per feature)
- **Honest summaries** (shows actual completion status, not inflated numbers)
- **Quality metrics tracking** (test pass rate, coverage percentage)

### Quality Gate Rules

Features are only marked as completed when they truly pass ALL quality gates:

1. **All tests must pass** - 100% test pass rate (exit code 0 from test runner)
2. **Coverage threshold met** - 80%+ code coverage
3. **No infinite retry loops** - Max 3 retry attempts per feature
4. **Clear failure tracking** - Failed features tracked separately from completed

### Data Classes

#### `EnforcementResult`
- **Purpose**: Result of completion gate enforcement check
- **Attributes**:
  - `passed` (bool): Whether the quality gate passed
  - `reason` (str): Human-readable reason (e.g., "Tests failed", "Coverage below threshold")
  - `test_failures` (int): Number of test failures
  - `coverage` (float): Test coverage percentage
  - `attempt_number` (int): Current retry attempt (1-3)
- **Methods**:
  - `to_dict()`: Convert to JSON-serializable dict

#### `RetryStrategy`
- **Purpose**: Escalation strategy for retry attempts
- **Attributes**:
  - `approach` (str): Strategy identifier (e.g., "fix_tests_first")
  - `description` (str): Human-readable description
  - `attempt_number` (int): Retry attempt number (1-3)

#### `CompletionSummary`
- **Purpose**: Honest summary of batch completion status
- **Attributes**:
  - `total_features` (int): Total features in batch
  - `completed_count` (int): Features that passed all quality gates
  - `failed_count` (int): Features that failed and exhausted retries
  - `skipped_count` (int): Features intentionally skipped
  - `completed_features` (List[str]): Feature descriptions that passed
  - `failed_features` (List[str]): Feature descriptions that failed
  - `skipped_features` (List[str]): Feature descriptions that were skipped
  - `average_coverage` (float): Average coverage across all features
- **Methods**:
  - `completion_rate()`: Percentage of features completed
  - `to_dict()`: Convert to JSON-serializable dict

### Main Functions

#### `enforce_completion_gate(feature_index, test_results)`
- **Purpose**: Check if feature passes all quality gates
- **Parameters**:
  - `feature_index` (int): Index of feature in batch
  - `test_results` (Dict): Results from test runner with `total`, `passed`, `failed`, `coverage`
- **Returns**: `EnforcementResult` with pass/fail decision
- **Logic**:
  1. Check if all tests passed (test_results['failed'] == 0)
  2. Check if coverage meets threshold (test_results['coverage'] >= 80%)
  3. Return result with reason if any check fails
- **Example**:
  ```python
  test_results = {"total": 10, "passed": 10, "failed": 0, "coverage": 85.0}
  result = enforce_completion_gate(0, test_results)
  if result.passed:
      print("Feature passed quality gate!")
  else:
      print(f"Gate failed: {result.reason}")
  ```

#### `retry_with_different_approach(feature_index, attempt_number, failure_reason)`
- **Purpose**: Select escalation strategy for retry attempts
- **Parameters**:
  - `feature_index` (int): Index of feature
  - `attempt_number` (int): Which retry (1, 2, or 3)
  - `failure_reason` (str): Why the feature failed
- **Returns**: `RetryStrategy` with next approach, or None if max attempts reached
- **Strategy Progression**:
  - **Attempt 1** (first retry): Basic retry - "Try again with same approach"
  - **Attempt 2** (second retry): Fix tests first - "Focus on making tests pass"
  - **Attempt 3** (third retry): Different implementation - "Try alternative approach"
  - **Beyond 3**: None (stop retrying)

#### `generate_honest_summary(batch_state)`
- **Purpose**: Generate accurate summary of batch completion status
- **Parameters**:
  - `batch_state` (BatchState): State object with feature results

- **Behavior**:
  - Counts completed features (passed all quality gates)
  - Counts failed features (exhausted retries without passing)
  - Counts skipped features (intentionally not implemented)
  - Calculates average coverage across all features
  - Never inflates numbers or hides failures
- **Example**:
  ```python
  summary = generate_honest_summary(batch_state)
  print(f"Completed: {summary.completed_count}/{summary.total_features}")
  print(f"Failed: {summary.failed_count}")
  print(f"Skipped: {summary.skipped_count}")

  - `feature_index` (int): Index of feature in batch
- **Returns**: `True` only if feature passed all quality gates (ready for closure)
- **Decision Logic**:
  - Feature completed (passed quality gate) → True (close issue)
  - Feature failed (exhausted retries) → False (keep open with 'blocked' label)
  - Feature skipped (not implemented) → False (keep open with 'blocked' label)

### Constants

- `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3`: Maximum retries per feature
- `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD = 80.0`: Minimum code coverage percentage

### Security

- **No Faking**: System never marks features as complete when tests failed
- **Audit Logging**: All enforcement decisions logged with timestamps
- **Path Validation**: batch_state path validated (CWE-22 prevention)
- **Input Sanitization**: Error messages sanitized for log injection (CWE-117)

### Test Coverage

  - Completion gate enforcement (all test outcomes)
  - Coverage threshold validation
  - Retry strategy selection (all 3 attempts)
  - Honest summary generation

## 25. agent_tracker package (1,755 lines, v3.44.0+, Issue #165)

**Purpose**: Portable tracking infrastructure for agent execution with dynamic project root detection

**Problem Solved (Issue #79)**: Original `scripts/agent_tracker.py` had hardcoded paths that failed when:
- Running from user projects (no `scripts/` directory)
- Running from project subdirectories (couldn't find project root)
- Commands invoked from installation path vs development path

**Solution (Issue #165 Refactoring)**: Monolithic library file (1,185 lines) split into focused package with 8 modules for maintainability:

**Package Structure** (`plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/agent_tracker/`):
- `__init__.py` (72 lines): Re-exports for backward compatibility
- `models.py` (64 lines): Data structures (AGENT_METADATA, EXPECTED_AGENTS)
- `state.py` (408 lines): Session state management and agent lifecycle
- `tracker.py` (478 lines): Main AgentTracker class with delegation pattern
- `metrics.py` (116 lines): Progress calculation and time estimation
- `verification.py` (311 lines): Parallel execution verification
- `display.py` (200 lines): Status display and visualization
- `cli.py` (98 lines): Command-line interface

**Backward Compatibility**: All imports continue to work via re-exports:
- Old: `from agent_tracker import AgentTracker` ✅ still works
- New: `from agent_tracker.tracker import AgentTracker` (preferred)
- Path utilities also re-exported for legacy code

**Benefits**:
- Dynamic project root detection via path_utils
- Portable path resolution (no hardcoded paths)
- Atomic file writes for data consistency
- Comprehensive error handling with context
- Clearer module responsibilities (each <500 lines)
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Better IDE support and code navigation

### Classes

#### `AgentTracker`
- **Purpose**: Track agent execution with structured logging
- **Location**: `tracker.py` (delegates to state manager)
- **Initialization**: `AgentTracker(session_file=None)`
  - `session_file` (Optional[str]): Path to session file for testing
  - If None: Creates/finds session file automatically using path_utils
  - Raises `ValueError` if session_file path is outside project (path traversal prevention)
- **Features**:
  - Auto-detects project root from any subdirectory
  - Creates `docs/sessions/` directory if missing
  - Finds or creates JSON session files with timestamp naming: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-pipeline.json`
  - Session isolation via `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`: when the env var is set, file selection filters to pipeline.json files whose stored `claude_session_id` field matches the current session, preventing cross-session pollution when multiple batches run on the same day (Issue #594). Falls back to latest file when env var is absent.
  - Schema compatibility via `setdefault("agents", [])` at all three session-file loading sites (Issue #576): session files that use the new pipeline schema and omit the `agents` key no longer raise `KeyError` on load.
  - Atomic writes using tempfile + rename pattern (Issue #45 security)
  - Path validation via shared security_utils module

### Public Methods

#### Agent Lifecycle Methods

#### `start_agent(agent_name, message)`
- **Purpose**: Log agent start time
- **Parameters**:
  - `agent_name` (str): Agent name (validated via security_utils)
  - `message` (str): Start message (max 10KB)
- **Records**:
  - Start timestamp (ISO format)
  - Agent name and status ("started")
  - Initial message
- **Security**: Input validation prevents injection attacks

#### `complete_agent(agent_name, message, tools=None, tools_used=None, github_issue=None)`
- **Purpose**: Log agent completion with optional metrics
- **Parameters**:
  - `agent_name` (str): Agent name
  - `message` (str): Completion message
  - `tools` (Optional[List[str]]): Tools declared to use (metadata)
  - `tools_used` (Optional[List[str]]): Tools actually used (audit trail)
  - `github_issue` (Optional[int]): Linked GitHub issue number
- **Records**:
  - Completion timestamp (ISO format)
  - Duration in seconds (auto-calculated from start)
  - Message and tool usage
  - Links to GitHub issue if provided
- **Returns**: Boolean indicating success
- **Error Handling**: Logs errors without raising (non-blocking)
- **Idempotency (Issue #57, #541)**: If agent is already in a terminal state ("completed" or "failed"), the call is a no-op. This prevents duplicate status entries when both an explicit `complete_agent()` call and the SubagentStop hook fire for the same agent.

#### `fail_agent(agent_name, message)`

  - Error message with context
  - Status set to "failed"
- **Security**: Error messages sanitized to prevent log injection
- **Idempotency (Issue #541)**: If agent is already in a terminal state ("completed" or "failed"), the call is a no-op. This prevents a late `fail_agent()` call (e.g. from a text-scan fallback in `unified_session_tracker.py`) from overwriting a correctly completed agent.

  - `False` if environment variable not set (graceful degradation)
- **Security**: Validates agent name format before logging
- **Used By**:
  - SubagentStop hook (log_agent_completion.py) - Issue #104

- Uses tempfile + rename pattern for consistency
- Process crash during write: Original file unchanged
- Prevents readers from seeing corrupted/partial JSON
- On POSIX: Rename is guaranteed atomic by OS

### Class Methods

#### `AgentTracker.save_agent_checkpoint()` (Issue #79, v3.36.0+)

**Signature**:
```python
@classmethod
def save_agent_checkpoint(
    cls,
    agent_name: str,
    message: str,
    github_issue: Optional[int] = None,
    tools_used: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> bool
```

**Purpose**: Convenience class method for agents to save checkpoints without creating AgentTracker instances. Solves the dogfooding bug (Issue #79) where hardcoded paths caused `/implement` to stall for 7+ hours.

**Parameters**:
- `agent_name` (str): Agent name (e.g., 'researcher', 'planner'). Must be alphanumeric + hyphen/underscore.
- `message` (str): Brief completion summary. Maximum 10KB.
- `github_issue` (Optional[int]): GitHub issue number being worked on. Range: 1-999999.
- `tools_used` (Optional[List[str]]): List of tools used during execution. Stored in session file for audit trail.

**Returns**: `bool`
- `True` if checkpoint saved successfully
- `False` if skipped due to graceful degradation (user project, import error, filesystem error)

**Behavior**:
- Uses portable path detection (works from any directory)
- Creates AgentTracker internally (caller doesn't manage instance)
- Validates all inputs before saving
- Gracefully degrades in user projects (prints info message, returns False)
- Never raises exceptions (non-blocking design)

**Examples**:

```python
# Basic usage (works from any directory)
from agent_tracker import AgentTracker

success = AgentTracker.save_agent_checkpoint(
    'researcher',
    'Found 3 JWT patterns in codebase'
)
if success:
    print("✅ Checkpoint saved")
else:
    print("ℹ️ Skipped (user project)")

# With all parameters
success = AgentTracker.save_agent_checkpoint(
    agent_name='planner',
    message='Architecture designed - see docs/design/auth.md',
    github_issue=79,
    tools_used=['FileSearch', 'Read', 'Write']
)

# In agent code (automatic error handling)
AgentTracker.save_agent_checkpoint(
    agent_name='implementer',
    message='Implementation complete - 450 lines of code',
    tools_used=['Read', 'Write', 'Execute']
)
# Even if this fails, agent continues working
```

**Security**:
- Input validation: agent_name, message, github_issue all validated
- Path validation: All paths checked against project root (CWE-22)
- No subprocess calls: Uses library imports (prevents CWE-78)
- Message length limit: Prevents log bloat attacks
- Graceful degradation: No sensitive error leakage

**Graceful Degradation**:
When running in environments without tracking infrastructure:
- User projects (no `plugins/` directory) -> skips, returns False
- Import errors (missing dependencies) -> skips, returns False
- Filesystem errors (permission denied) -> skips, returns False
- Unexpected errors -> logs warning, returns False

This allows agents to be portable across development and user environments.

**Design Pattern**: Progressive Enhancement - feature works with or without supporting infrastructure

**Related**: GitHub Issue #79 (Dogfooding bug fix), Issue #82 (Optional checkpoint verification)

### Module Architecture (Issue #165)

**Purpose of Refactoring**: Split monolithic 1,185-line file into focused modules for:
- Easier testing (unit test each responsibility separately)
- Better maintainability (changes isolated to relevant modules)
- Clearer code organization (each module has single responsibility)
- Performance monitoring (metrics in dedicated module)
- Display logic separation (display.py handles all formatting)

**Delegation Pattern**:
- `tracker.py` (441 lines): AgentTracker class coordinates via delegation
- Methods call specialized manager classes from other modules
- Reduces complexity: Main class focuses on public API, not implementation details
- Example: `calculate_progress()` delegates to `metrics.calculate_progress()`

**State Management** (state.py - 408 lines):
- `StateManager` class handles session file I/O
- Tracks agent start/completion times
- Manages JSON serialization and atomic writes
- Enforces security constraints (path validation)

**Metrics Calculation** (metrics.py - 116 lines):
- `MetricsCalculator` class handles all time-based calculations
- Progress percentage, average duration, remaining time estimates
- No I/O operations (pure calculation)
- Easy to unit test

**Verification Logic** (verification.py - 311 lines):
- `ParallelVerifier` class handles parallel execution checks
- Validates checkpoint requirements (agents completed, time thresholds)
- Extracts and formats metrics for display
- Used by CHECKPOINT 1 and CHECKPOINT 4.1

**Display Formatting** (display.py - 200 lines):
- `DisplayFormatter` class handles all output formatting
- ANSI colors, emoji status indicators, tree view generation
- Separated from logic (can swap formatters for testing)
- Enables future HTML/JSON output formats

**Data Models** (models.py - 64 lines):
- Constants: `AGENT_METADATA`, `EXPECTED_AGENTS` per workflow
- Enum for agent status values
- Type hints for consistency

**CLI Wrapper** (cli.py - 98 lines):
- Command-line interface delegating to AgentTracker
- Commands: start, complete, fail, status, set-github-issue
- Argument parsing and error handling

### CLI Wrapper

**File**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/agent_tracker.py`
- **Purpose**: CLI interface for library functionality
- **Design**: Delegates to `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/agent_tracker/` package
- **Commands**:
  - `start <agent_name> <message>`: Start agent tracking
  - `complete <agent_name> <message> [--tools tool1,tool2]`: Complete agent
  - `fail <agent_name> <message>`: Log failure
  - `status`: Display current status
- **Backward Compatibility**: Installed plugin uses lib version directly

### Deprecation (Issue #79)

**Deprecated**: `scripts/agent_tracker.py` (original location)
- **Reason**: Hardcoded paths fail in user projects and subdirectories
- **Migration**:
  - For CLI: Use `plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/agent_tracker.py` (installed plugin)
  - For imports: Use `from plugins.autonomous_dev.lib.agent_tracker import AgentTracker`
  - Existing code continues to work (delegates to library implementation)
  - Will be removed in v4.0.0

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage (Standard Mode)
```python
from agent_tracker import AgentTracker

# Create tracker (auto-detects project root)
tracker = AgentTracker()

# Log agent start
tracker.start_agent("researcher", "Researching JWT patterns")

# Log agent completion
tracker.complete_agent("researcher", "Found 3 patterns",
                       tools_used=["WebSearch", "Grep", "Read"],
                       github_issue=79)

# Display status
tracker.show_status()
```

#### Testing with Explicit Session File
```python
from pathlib import Path
tracker = AgentTracker(session_file="/tmp/test-session.json")
tracker.start_agent("test-agent", "Testing")
```

#### Checkpoint Verification (auto-implement.md)
```python
tracker = AgentTracker()

# Verify parallel exploration (STEP 1)
if tracker.verify_parallel_exploration():
    print("✅ PARALLEL EXPLORATION: SUCCESS")
    metrics = tracker.get_parallel_validation_metrics()
    print(f"Time saved: {metrics['time_saved']}s ({metrics['efficiency_percent']}%)")
else:
    print("⚠️ Parallel exploration verification failed")
    # Workflow continues regardless (graceful degradation)
```

### Error Handling

All exceptions include context and guidance:
```python
try:
    tracker = AgentTracker(session_file="../../etc/passwd")
except ValueError as e:
    # Error includes: what went wrong, why, and what's expected
    # Example: "Path traversal attempt detected: /etc/passwd"
    print(e)
```

### Test Coverage
- 66+ unit tests (85.7% coverage) in `tests/unit/lib/test_agent_tracker_issue79.py`
- Integration tests for checkpoint verification
- Path resolution from nested subdirectories
- Atomic write pattern verification
- Security validation (path traversal, symlinks, input bounds)

### Used By
- `/implement` command checkpoints (parallel exploration, parallel validation)
- `/implement --batch` for pipeline tracking
- Dogfooding infrastructure in autonomous-dev repo
- Optional checkpoint verification (graceful degradation in user projects)

### Related
- GitHub Issue #79 (Dogfooding bug - tracking infrastructure hardcoded paths)
- GitHub Issue #82 (Optional checkpoint verification with graceful degradation)
- GitHub Issue #45 (Atomic write pattern and security hardening)
- GitHub Issue #165 (Package refactoring - monolithic to modular)
- path_utils.py (Dynamic project root detection)

### Design Patterns
- **Two-tier Design**: Library (core logic) + CLI wrapper (interface)
- **Delegation Pattern**: AgentTracker delegates to specialized manager classes
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features gracefully degrade if infrastructure unavailable
- **Atomic Writes**: Tempfile + rename for consistency
- **Path Portability**: Uses path_utils instead of hardcoded paths
- **Modular Responsibility**: Each module handles single concern (~100-400 lines)

- Comprehensive docstrings with design patterns

### Classes

#### `SessionTracker`
- **Purpose**: Log agent actions to session file instead of keeping in context
- **Base Class**: Inherits from `StateManager[str]` (Issue #224)
  - Generic type is `str` for markdown content
  - Implements abstract methods: `load_state()`, `save_state()`, `cleanup_state()`
  - Uses inherited helpers: `_validate_state_path()`, `_atomic_write()`, `_get_file_lock()`, `_audit_operation()`
- **Initialization**: `SessionTracker(session_file=None, use_cache=True)`
  - `session_file` (Optional[str]): Path to session file for testing
  - `use_cache` (bool): If True, use cached project root (default: True)
  - If None: Creates/finds session file automatically using path_utils
  - Raises `StateError` if session_file path is invalid or outside project
- **Features**:
  - Auto-detects project root from any subdirectory
  - Creates `docs/sessions/` directory if missing
  - Finds or creates session files with timestamp naming: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-session.md`
  - Path validation via shared validation module

- **Purpose**: Save session markdown content to file with atomic writes
- **Parameters**: `state` (str) - Markdown content to save
- **Raises**: `StateError` if save fails
- **Features**:
  - Uses inherited atomic write pattern (temp file + rename)
  - Thread-safe with file locking
  - Path validation to prevent CWE-22 (path traversal)
  - Sets restrictive permissions (0o600)
- **Example**:
  ```python
  tracker = SessionTracker()

  - Thread-safe with file locking
  - Only removes file if it exists
- **Example**:
  ```python
  tracker = SessionTracker()
  tracker.cleanup_state()
  assert not tracker.session_file.exists()
  ```

### Helper Functions

#### `get_default_session_file() -> Path`
- **Purpose**: Get default session file path with timestamp
- **Returns**: Path object for new session file
- **Format**: `<session_dir>/session-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
- **Uses**: path_utils.get_session_dir() for portable resolution
- **Example**:
  ```python
  path = get_default_session_file()
  print(path.name)  # session-2025-11-19-143022.md
  ```

### File Format

Session files stored in `docs/sessions/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-session.md`:

```markdown
# Session 20251119-143022

**Started**: 2025-11-19 14:30:22

---

**14:30:25 - researcher**: Research complete - docs/research/jwt-patterns.md

**14:35:10 - planner**: Plan complete - docs/design/auth-architecture.md

**14:45:30 - test-master**: Tests written - 12 test cases

**15:02:15 - implementer**: Implementation complete - src/auth/jwt_handler.py
```

### Security Features

#### Path Validation (CWE-22)
- All paths validated via validation module
- Rejects paths outside project directory
- Uses path_utils for consistent resolution
- Audit logging on validation errors

#### Permission Checking (CWE-732)
- Warns if session directory is world-writable
- Checks ownership on POSIX systems
- Gracefully handles Windows (different permission model)

#### Input Validation
- Agent names must match `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/` (via validation module)
- Messages limited to reasonable length
- Control characters filtered to prevent log injection

### CLI Wrapper

**File**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/session_tracker.py`
- **Purpose**: CLI interface for library functionality
- **Design**: Delegates to `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/session_tracker.py`
- **Usage**: `python plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/session_tracker.py <agent_name> <message>`
- **Example**: `python plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/session_tracker.py researcher "Found 3 JWT patterns"`

### Deprecation (Issue #79)

**Deprecated**: `scripts/session_tracker.py` (original location)
- **Reason**: Hardcoded paths fail in user projects and subdirectories
- **Migration**:
  - For CLI: Use `plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/session_tracker.py` (installed plugin)
  - For imports: Use `from plugins.autonomous-dev.lib.session_tracker import SessionTracker`
  - Existing code continues to work (delegates to library implementation)
  - Will be removed in v4.0.0

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Session Logging
```python
from plugins.autonomous_dev.lib.session_tracker import SessionTracker

# Create tracker (auto-detects project root)
tracker = SessionTracker()

# Log agent actions
tracker.log("researcher", "Found 3 JWT patterns in codebase")
tracker.log("planner", "Architecture designed - see docs/design/auth.md")
tracker.log("test-master", "12 test cases written")
tracker.log("implementer", "Implementation complete - 450 lines of code")
```

#### Testing with Explicit Session File
```python
from pathlib import Path
tracker = SessionTracker(session_file="/tmp/test-session.md")
tracker.log("test-agent", "Testing portable path detection")
```

#### From auto-implement Checkpoints
```bash
# Log from bash (CHECKPOINT 1)
python plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/session_tracker.py auto-implement "Parallel exploration completed"

# Log from bash (CHECKPOINT 4.1)
python plugins/autonomous-dev/scripts/session_tracker.py auto-implement "Parallel validation completed"
```

### Error Handling

StateError exceptions include context and guidance:
```python
try:
    tracker = SessionTracker(session_file="../../etc/passwd")
except StateError as e:
    # Error includes: what went wrong, why, and what's expected
    # Example: "Path traversal attempt detected: /etc/passwd"
    print(e)

try:
    content = tracker.load_state()
except StateError as e:
    # Handles: file not found, read errors, path validation failures
    print(e)
```

Backward Compatibility:
- Exceptions raised during `__init__` (path validation) may raise exceptions inherited from StateError
- StateError is a subclass of AutonomousDevError for consistent error handling

### Test Coverage
- 30+ unit tests in `tests/unit/lib/test_session_tracker.py`
- Path resolution from nested subdirectories
- Session file creation and appending
- Directory permission checking
- Input validation (agent names, messages)
- Security validation (path traversal, symlinks)

### Used By
- `/implement` command checkpoints (progress tracking)
- `/implement --batch` for feature logging
- Dogfooding infrastructure (session logs in docs/sessions/)
- CI/CD pipelines for audit trails
- Optional checkpoint logging (graceful degradation in user projects)

- validation.py (Path and input validation)
- agent_tracker.py (Agent execution tracking)

### Design Patterns
- **Two-tier Design**: Library (core logic) + CLI wrapper (interface)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features gracefully degrade if unavailable
- **Portable Paths**: Uses path_utils instead of hardcoded paths
- **Non-blocking**: Logging failures don't break workflows
- **StateManager ABC Integration** (Issue #224): Standardized state management

## 26. workflow_tracker.py (528 lines, v3.48.0+, Issue #155)

**Purpose**: Workflow state tracking for preference learning - records which quality workflow steps were taken/skipped, detects user corrections from feedback, and learns preferences over time.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/workflow_tracker.py`

**Problem Solved (Issue #155)**: Claude can't remember workflow preferences across sessions. This library enables learning from user corrections to improve workflow decisions over time.

### Key Features

- **Step tracking**: Records which quality steps were taken (research, testing, planning, review, security, docs, etc.) vs skipped
- **Correction detection**: Parses user feedback patterns to detect improvement signals
- **Preference learning**: Derives user preferences from correction patterns over time
- **Privacy-preserving**: Local storage only (~/.autonomous-dev/workflow_state.json), no cloud sync
- **Atomic persistence**: Thread-safe with file locking for concurrent access
- **Time-based decay**: Preferences evolve as user practices change (configurable 30-day window)

### Quick Start

```python
from workflow_tracker import WorkflowTracker, detect_correction

# Track workflow steps
tracker = WorkflowTracker()
tracker.start_session()
tracker.record_step("research", taken=True)
tracker.record_step("testing", taken=False, reason="quick fix")
tracker.save()

# Detect corrections in user feedback
correction = detect_correction("you should have researched first")
if correction:
    tracker.record_correction(correction["step"], correction["text"])

# Get learned preferences
prefs = tracker.get_preferences()
recommended = tracker.get_recommended_steps()
```

### Workflow Steps

8 quality workflow steps tracked:

- `alignment` - PROJECT.md alignment check
- `research` - Codebase/web research
- `planning` - Implementation planning
- `testing` - TDD tests
- `implementation` - Code implementation
- `review` - Code review
- `security` - Security audit
- `documentation` - Doc updates

### Public API

#### `detect_correction(user_input: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, str]]`

**Purpose**: Detect correction signals in user feedback using pattern matching

**Parameters**:
- `user_input` (str): User's message text

**Returns**: Dict with 'step', 'text', 'pattern', 'keyword' if detected, None otherwise

**Patterns Detected**:
- "you should have X" → `should_have` pattern
- "need to X first" → `need_to` pattern
- "forgot to X" → `forgot` pattern
- "should always X" → `always_should` pattern
- "didn't X" → `didnt` pattern
- "should X before" → `should_before` pattern

**Example**:
```python
result = detect_correction("you should have researched first")
# Returns: {
#   'step': 'research',
#   'text': 'you should have researched first',
#   'pattern': 'should_have',
#   'keyword': 'researched'
# }
```

#### `class WorkflowTracker`

Main tracker for session and preference management.

**Constructor**:
```python
tracker = WorkflowTracker(state_file: Optional[Path] = None)
```

**Parameters**:
- `state_file` (Optional[Path]): Custom state file path (default: ~/.autonomous-dev/workflow_state.json)

**Attributes**:
- `state_file: Path` - Path to workflow state JSON file
- `_state: Dict[str, Any]` - In-memory state dict
- `_current_session: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` - Current active session

### Session Management Methods

#### `start_session(task_type: Optional[str] = None) -> str`

Start a new workflow session.

**Parameters**:
- `task_type` (Optional[str]): Task type for context (e.g., 'feature', 'bugfix', 'docs')

**Returns**: Session ID (UUID string)

**Example**:
```python
session_id = tracker.start_session(task_type="feature")
```

#### `end_session() -> None`

End current session and add to history. Automatically saves state.

**Trimming**: Keeps max 50 most recent sessions to prevent unbounded growth

#### `get_sessions() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

Get all recorded sessions.

**Returns**: List of session dicts with session_id, started_at, ended_at, steps, task_type

#### `get_current_session_steps() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

Get steps from current active session.

**Returns**: List of step records with step name, taken (bool), timestamp, optional reason

### Step Tracking Methods

#### `record_step(step: str, taken: bool, reason: Optional[str] = None) -> None`

Record a workflow step taken or skipped.

**Parameters**:
- `step` (str): Step name (alignment, research, testing, etc.)
- `taken` (bool): True if step was taken, False if skipped
- `reason` (Optional[str]): Why step was skipped (e.g., 'quick fix', 'already researched')

**Example**:
```python
tracker.record_step("testing", taken=False, reason="quick fix")
tracker.record_step("documentation", taken=True)
```

### Correction Tracking Methods

#### `record_correction(step: str, text: str, task_type: Optional[str] = None) -> None`

Record a user correction to update preferences.

**Parameters**:
- `step` (str): Step that was corrected
- `text` (str): Original user text that contained correction
- `task_type` (Optional[str]): Task type for context-specific learning

**Behavior**: Increments correction count for the step and updates task-type preferences

**Example**:
```python
tracker.record_correction("research", "you should have researched first", task_type="feature")
```

#### `get_corrections() -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

Get all recorded corrections.

**Returns**: List of correction dicts with step, text, timestamp, task_type

### Preference Learning Methods

#### `get_preferences() -> Dict[str, Any]`

Get learned preferences.

**Returns**: Dict with:
- `emphasized_steps` (Dict[str, int]): step → correction count
- `task_type_preferences` (Dict[str, Dict[str, int]]): task_type → {step → count}

#### `get_recommended_steps(task_type: Optional[str] = None) -> List[str]`

Get recommended workflow steps based on learned preferences.

**Parameters**:
- `task_type` (Optional[str]): Task type for context-specific recommendations

**Returns**: List of step names in priority order (most corrections first)

**Algorithm**:
- Steps above `CORRECTION_THRESHOLD` (default: 3) are recommended
- Task-type specific steps merged with general preferences
- Results sorted by correction count (highest priority first)

**Example**:
```python
# After 3+ corrections for research step
recommended = tracker.get_recommended_steps()
# Returns: ['research', ...]

# Task-specific recommendations
recommended = tracker.get_recommended_steps(task_type="bugfix")
# Returns: ['security', 'testing', ...] if those were corrected for bugfixes
```

#### `apply_preference_decay() -> None`

Apply time-based decay to old corrections.

**Behavior**:
- Removes corrections older than `PREFERENCE_DECAY_DAYS` (default: 30)
- Allows preferences to evolve as user practices change
- Updates emphasized_steps from recent corrections only

**Example**:
```python
# Run weekly to keep preferences fresh
tracker.apply_preference_decay()
tracker.save()
```

### Persistence Methods

#### `save() -> bool`

Save state to file using atomic write.

**Returns**: True if save succeeded, False otherwise

**Implementation**:
- Atomic write: Tempfile + rename pattern
- Creates ~/.autonomous-dev/ directory if missing
- Updates metadata timestamps
- Graceful error handling (non-blocking)

### State File Format

**Location**: ~/.autonomous-dev/workflow_state.json

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "session_id": "abc123-...",
      "started_at": "2025-12-17T10:30:00Z",

    "updated_at": "2025-12-17T10:45:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Configuration Constants

- `MAX_SESSIONS = 50` - Maximum sessions to keep
- `CORRECTION_THRESHOLD = 3` - Minimum corrections to emphasize a step
- `PREFERENCE_DECAY_DAYS = 30` - Days before old corrections decay
- `WORKFLOW_STEPS` - List of 8 quality workflow steps

### Keyword Matching

Step detection from user text uses keyword mappings:

```python
STEP_KEYWORDS = {
    "research": ["research", "searched", "looked", "checked", "investigated"],
    "testing": ["test", "tested", "tests", "tdd", "unittest", "write"],
    "planning": ["plan", "planned", "planning", "design"],
    "review": ["review", "reviewed", "check", "checked"],
    "security": ["security", "secure", "audit", "audited", "vulnerability", "run"],
    "documentation": ["document", "documented", "docs", "readme"],
    "alignment": ["align", "aligned", "project", "goals"],
    "implementation": ["implement", "implemented", "code", "coded"],
}
```

### Thread Safety

- Thread-safe with `threading.RLock()` for concurrent access
- Atomic file writes prevent corruption
- In-memory state protected by lock

### Error Handling

All errors are non-blocking:
- Load errors (corrupted JSON, missing file) → return defaults
- Save errors (permission denied, disk full) → log and continue
- Invalid inputs → logged but don't raise exceptions

### CLI Entry Point

```bash
# Detect correction in text
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/workflow_tracker.py detect "you should have researched first"

# Show learned preferences
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/workflow_tracker.py preferences

# Show session count
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/workflow_tracker.py sessions
```

### Usage Examples

#### Tracking a feature development workflow
```python
from workflow_tracker import WorkflowTracker

tracker = WorkflowTracker()
tracker.start_session(task_type="feature")

# Took research step
tracker.record_step("research", taken=True)

# Skipped testing due to small change
tracker.record_step("testing", taken=False, reason="small change")

# Took other steps
tracker.record_step("implementation", taken=True)
tracker.record_step("review", taken=True)
tracker.record_step("security", taken=True)

tracker.end_session()
tracker.save()
```

#### Learning from user feedback
```python
from workflow_tracker import WorkflowTracker, detect_correction

tracker = WorkflowTracker()

# User says: "you should have written tests before implementing"
feedback = "you should have written tests before implementing"
correction = detect_correction(feedback)

if correction:
    # correction = {'step': 'testing', 'text': '...', 'pattern': 'should_have', 'keyword': 'written'}
    tracker.record_correction(correction['step'], feedback, task_type="feature")
    tracker.save()

# After 3+ corrections on testing for features
tracker.apply_preference_decay()
recommended = tracker.get_recommended_steps(task_type="feature")
# recommended = ['testing', ...] (emphasized because of corrections)
```

#### Preference-based workflow recommendations
```python
tracker = WorkflowTracker()

# Get user's learned preferences
prefs = tracker.get_preferences()
emphasized = prefs.get("emphasized_steps", {})

# Use in decision-making
if "testing" in emphasized and emphasized["testing"] >= 3:
    # User frequently corrected skipping tests
    # Recommend always taking testing step
    print("Based on your feedback, testing is important")
```

### Design Patterns

- **Non-blocking**: All saves gracefully degrade if they fail
- **Atomic writes**: Tempfile + rename prevents corruption
- **Thread-safe**: RLock protects concurrent access
- **Preference decay**: Old corrections naturally fade (30 days default)
- **Progressive learning**: Tracks both sessions and corrections

### Performance Characteristics

- **Session storage**: Max 50 sessions × ~500 bytes = 25KB typical
- **Correction tracking**: Unlimited, but old corrections decay
- **Save latency**: <100ms for typical state size
- **Memory footprint**: <10MB with 50 sessions + history

### Security Features

- **Local storage only**: No cloud sync, no network calls
- **User home directory**: ~/.autonomous-dev/ owned by user
- **Atomic writes**: Prevents partial corruption
- **No sensitive data**: No passwords, keys, or PII stored
- **Privacy preserving**: Data never leaves machine

### Related Components

**Imports**:
- `threading` - Thread-safe access
- `tempfile` - Atomic writes
- `json` - State serialization
- `pathlib.Path` - Path handling
- `uuid` - Session ID generation
- `datetime` - Timestamp recording
- `dataclasses` - Optional future enhancement
- `regex` - Correction pattern detection

**Used By**:
- Future: Agent learning system (preference-based decision making)
- Future: Claude's workflow optimization
- Testing: Preference learning validation

**Related Issues**:
- GitHub Issue #155 - Workflow state tracking for preference learning
- GitHub Issue #140 - Agent skills and knowledge injection (related)
- GitHub Issue #148 - Claude Code 2.0 compliance (context)

### Troubleshooting

**Permissions Denied**: If ~/.autonomous-dev/ creation fails:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.autonomous-dev
chmod 700 ~/.autonomous-dev
```

**State File Corruption**: Corrupted JSON is automatically handled:
```python
# Corrupted file is ignored, fresh state created
tracker = WorkflowTracker()
tracker.save()  # Creates new clean state file
```

**Preference Not Learning**: Check correction recording:
```python
tracker = WorkflowTracker()
corrections = tracker.get_corrections()
prefs = tracker.get_preferences()
print(f"Corrections: {len(corrections)}")
print(f"Preferences: {prefs}")
```

## Design Pattern

**Progressive Enhancement**: Libraries use string → path → whitelist validation pattern, allowing graceful error recovery

**Non-blocking Enhancements**: Version detection, orphan cleanup, hook activation, parity validation, git automation, issue automation, and brownfield retrofit don't block core operations

**Two-tier Design**:
- Core logic libraries (plugin_updater.py, auto_implement_git_integration.py, brownfield_retrofit.py + 5 phase libraries)
- CLI interface scripts (update_plugin.py, auto_git_workflow.py, align_project_retrofit.py)
- Enables reuse and testing
- Note: /create-issue uses direct gh CLI (no wrapper library)

**Optional Features**: Feature automation and other enhancements are controlled by flags/hooks

Detect MCP server type from tool name and parameters.

**Parameters**:
- `tool_name` (str): MCP tool function name
- `params` (Dict[str, Any]): Tool parameters

**Returns**: `MCPServerType` enum value

**Detection Logic**:

**Example**:
```python
from mcp_server_detector import detect_mcp_server, MCPServerType

# Filesystem detection
server = detect_mcp_server("read_file", {"path": "src/main.py"})
assert server == MCPServerType.FILESYSTEM

# Git detection
server = detect_mcp_server("git_status", {"repo": "/project"})
assert server == MCPServerType.GIT

server = detect_mcp_server("run_command", {"command": "pytest tests/"})
assert server == MCPServerType.BASH

# Unknown
server = detect_mcp_server("unknown_tool", {})
assert server == MCPServerType.UNKNOWN
```

### Tool Name Patterns

## 38. auto_approval_engine.py (489 lines, v3.38.0)

**Purpose**: Core engine for MCP tool auto-approval with 6-layer defense-in-depth validation

**Issue**: #73 (MCP Auto-Approval), #98 (PreToolUse Consolidation)

### Classes

#### `AutoApprovalEngine`

Main engine for tool approval decisions with comprehensive security validation.

**Methods**:

##### `evaluate_tool_call(tool_name: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> ApprovalDecision`

Evaluate whether a tool call should be auto-approved.

**Parameters**:
- `tool_name` (str): Name of the MCP tool to evaluate
- `params` (Dict[str, Any]): Tool parameters/arguments

**Returns**: `ApprovalDecision` dataclass with fields:
- `approved` (bool): Whether call is approved
- `reason` (str): Explanation of decision
- `layer_violations` (List[str]): Failed validation layers
- `confidence_score` (float): 0.0-1.0 confidence in decision

**Validation Layers** (defense-in-depth):
1. **Subagent Context** - Only auto-approve if running as subagent (agent identity resolved via `agent_type` from stdin JSON, falling back to `CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME` env var — Issue #591)
2. **User Consent** - Verify user has opted in via `MCP_AUTO_APPROVE` env var
3. **Agent Whitelist** - Check if current agent is in allowed list
4. **Tool Whitelist** - Validate tool name against approved tools list
5. **Parameter Validation** - Check parameters for dangerous patterns
6. **Circuit Breaker** - Auto-disable after repeated denials

**Example**:
```python
from auto_approval_engine import AutoApprovalEngine

engine = AutoApprovalEngine()

# Approve safe tool call
decision = engine.evaluate_tool_call(
    "Read",
    {"file_path": "src/main.py"}
)
assert decision.approved == True
assert "parameter validation passed" in decision.reason

# Deny dangerous tool call
decision = engine.evaluate_tool_call(
    "Bash",
    {"command": "rm -rf /"}
)
assert decision.approved == False
assert "parameter validation" in decision.layer_violations
```

## 39. tool_validator.py (900 lines, v3.40.0)

**Purpose**: Tool call validation with whitelist/blacklist, injection detection, path containment validation, and parameter analysis

**Issue**: #73 (MCP Auto-Approval), #98 (PreToolUse Consolidation)

**New in v3.40.0**: Path extraction and containment validation for destructive shell commands (rm, mv, cp, chmod, chown) - prevents CWE-22 (path traversal) and CWE-59 (symlink attacks) when files are modified.

### Classes

#### `ToolValidator`

Validates MCP tool calls against security policies with path-aware containment validation for destructive commands.

**Methods**:

##### `validate_tool(tool_name: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult`

Comprehensive validation of tool calls.

**Parameters**:
- `tool_name` (str): Tool name to validate
- `params` (Dict[str, Any]): Tool parameters

**Returns**: `ValidationResult` dataclass with:
- `valid` (bool): Overall validation result
- `violations` (List[str]): Security violations found
- `severity` (str): "critical", "high", "medium", "low", "none"
- `recommendations` (List[str]): How to fix violations

**Validation Checks**:
1. **Whitelist Check** - Tool must be in approved list
2. **Blacklist Check** - Tool must not be explicitly denied
3. **Path Traversal** - Detect `..`, `/etc/passwd`, symlink attacks
4. **Injection Patterns** - Detect shell metacharacters, command chaining
5. **Path Containment** (NEW v3.40.0) - Validate extracted paths are within project boundaries
6. **Sensitive Files** - Block access to `.env`, `.ssh`, secrets
7. **SSRF Detection** - Detect localhost, private IPs, metadata services
8. **Parameter Size** - Reject suspiciously large parameters

**Example**:
```python
from tool_validator import ToolValidator, ValidationResult

validator = ToolValidator()

# Valid tool call
result = validator.validate_tool("Read", {"file_path": "src/main.py"})
assert result.valid == True
assert result.severity == "none"

# Invalid - path traversal
result = validator.validate_tool(
    "Read",
    {"file_path": "../../.env"}
)
assert result.valid == False
assert result.severity == "critical"
assert any("path traversal" in v for v in result.violations)

# Valid - rm within project boundaries
result = validator.validate_bash_command("rm src/temp.py")
assert result.approved == True

# Invalid - rm outside project
result = validator.validate_bash_command("rm ../../../etc/passwd")
assert result.approved == False
assert "path traversal" in result.reason
```

##### `_extract_paths_from_command(command: str) -> List[str]` (NEW v3.40.0)

Extract file paths from destructive shell commands for containment validation.

**Purpose**: Identifies files that will be modified by rm/mv/cp/chmod/chown commands so they can be validated against project boundaries.

**Supported Commands**:
- `rm` - Remove files/directories
- `mv` - Move files/directories
- `cp` - Copy files/directories
- `chmod` - Change file permissions
- `chown` - Change file ownership

**Parameters**:
- `command` (str): Shell command string to parse

**Returns**: List of file paths extracted from command, or empty list if:
- Command is non-destructive (ls, cat, etc.)
- Command contains wildcards (asterisk or question mark) - cannot validate at static analysis time
- Command is empty or malformed (unclosed quotes)

**Behavior**:
- Uses shlex.split() for proper quote/escape handling
- Filters out flags (arguments starting with dash)
- Skips mode/ownership arguments for chmod/chown
- Gracefully handles malformed commands (returns empty list)

**Security Notes**:
- Wildcard commands return empty list (conservative approach - cannot validate)
- Symlinks are resolved and validated separately by _validate_path_containment()
- Only destructive commands checked (non-destructive commands skip validation)

**Example**:
```python
validator = ToolValidator()

# Extract paths from rm command
paths = validator._extract_paths_from_command("rm file.txt")
# Returns: ["file.txt"]

# Extract multiple paths from mv
paths = validator._extract_paths_from_command("mv src.txt dst.txt")
# Returns: ["src.txt", "dst.txt"]

# Wildcards skip validation (conservative)
paths = validator._extract_paths_from_command("rm *.txt")
# Returns: []  # Cannot validate wildcard expansion

# Non-destructive commands skip validation
paths = validator._extract_paths_from_command("ls file.txt")
# Returns: []  # No containment validation needed
```

##### `_validate_path_containment(paths: List[str], project_root: Path) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]` (NEW v3.40.0)

Validate that all paths are contained within project boundaries.

**Purpose**: Prevents CWE-22 (path traversal) and CWE-59 (symlink attacks) by ensuring destructive operations only affect files within the project.

**Validation Checks**:
- **Path Traversal** - Reject traversal style escapes like ../../../etc/passwd
- **Absolute Paths** - Reject /etc/passwd outside project
- **Symlinks** - Reject symlinks pointing outside project
- **Home Directory** - Reject ~/ expansion (except whitelisted ~/.claude/)
- **Invalid Characters** - Reject paths with null bytes or newlines

**Parameters**:
- `paths` (List[str]): File paths to validate
- `project_root` (Path): Project root directory (containment boundary)

**Returns**: Tuple of:
- (True, None) - All paths valid and contained
- (False, error_message) - First invalid path with description

**Special Cases**:
- **Empty list**: Always valid (no paths to validate)
- **~/.claude/**: Whitelisted for Claude Code system files
- **Other ~/ paths**: Rejected (outside project boundaries)

**Security Features**:
- Checks for null bytes and newlines - injection risk
- Expands tilde to absolute path before validation
- Resolves symlinks and validates target location
- Uses is_relative_to() for containment check (Python 3.9+) with fallback for 3.8
- Distinguishes between path traversal vs absolute path violations in error messages

**Example**:
```python
validator = ToolValidator()
project_root = Path("/tmp/project")  # Example project root

# Valid - relative path within project
is_valid, error = validator._validate_path_containment(
    ["src/main.py"],
    project_root
)
assert is_valid == True
assert error is None

# Invalid - path traversal attempt
is_valid, error = validator._validate_path_containment(
    ["../../../etc/passwd"],
    project_root
)
assert is_valid == False
assert "path traversal" in error

# Invalid - absolute path outside project
is_valid, error = validator._validate_path_containment(
    ["/etc/passwd"],
    project_root
)
assert is_valid == False
assert "absolute path" in error and "outside" in error

# Invalid - symlink to outside
is_valid, error = validator._validate_path_containment(
    ["link_to_etc"],
    project_root
)
assert is_valid == False
assert "symlink" in error

# Whitelisted - .claude directory
is_valid, error = validator._validate_path_containment(
    ["~/.claude/config.json"],
    project_root
)
assert is_valid == True

# Invalid - other home directory paths
is_valid, error = validator._validate_path_containment(
    ["~/.ssh/id_rsa"],
    project_root
)
assert is_valid == False
assert "home directory" in error
```

### Integration with validate_bash_command()

When validate_bash_command() processes a command:
1. Checks command against blacklist
2. NEW v3.40.0: Extracts paths from destructive commands
3. NEW v3.40.0: Validates paths are contained within project boundaries
4. Checks for command injection patterns
5. Checks against whitelist
6. Denies by default (conservative approach)

This ensures commands like rm ../../../etc/passwd are blocked before execution, even if they pass other validation layers.

## 40. unified_pre_tool_use.py (467 lines, v3.38.0)

**Purpose**: Library-based PreToolUse hook implementation combining auto-approval and security validation

**Issue**: #95 (MCP Security), #98 (PreToolUse Consolidation)

### Main Class

#### `UnifiedPreToolUseHook`

Main hook handler that coordinates auto-approval and security validation.

**Methods**:

##### `on_pre_tool_use(tool_call: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]`

Claude Code PreToolUse lifecycle hook handler.

**Parameters**:
- `tool_call` (Dict[str, Any]): Tool call with `tool_name` and `tool_input`

**Returns**: Hook response dict with:
- `hookSpecificOutput`: Dict containing:
  - `hookEventName`: "PreToolUse"
  - `permissionDecision`: "allow" or "deny"
  - `permissionDecisionReason`: Explanation

**Workflow**:
1. Parse tool call from JSON input
2. Run auto-approval engine
3. If not auto-approved, run security validation
4. Log decision to audit trail
5. Return decision to Claude Code

**Example**:
```python
from unified_pre_tool_use import UnifiedPreToolUseHook

hook = UnifiedPreToolUseHook()

# Tool call
tool_call = {
    "tool_name": "Bash",
    "tool_input": {"command": "pytest tests/"}
}

# Get decision
response = hook.on_pre_tool_use(tool_call)
assert response["hookSpecificOutput"]["permissionDecision"] == "allow"
```

### Integration

This library is used by both:
1. `plugins/autonomous-dev/hooks/pre_tool_use.py` - Standalone shell script wrapper
2. Direct Python imports in custom hooks

## 41. settings_merger.py (432 lines, v3.39.0)

**Purpose**: Merge template settings.local.json with user settings while preserving customizations

**Issue**: #98 (Settings Merge on Marketplace Sync)

### Main Class

#### `SettingsMerger`

Handles merging template settings with user settings during marketplace sync operations.

**Constructor**:
```python
def __init__(self, project_root: str)
```

**Parameters**:
- `project_root` (str): Project root directory for path validation

**Methods**:

##### `merge_settings(template_path: Path, user_path: Path, write_result: bool = True) -> MergeResult`

Merge template settings with user settings, preserving customizations.

**Parameters**:
- `template_path` (Path): Path to template settings.local.json
- `user_path` (Path): Path to user settings.local.json
- `write_result` (bool): Whether to write merged settings (False for dry-run)

**Returns**: `MergeResult` dataclass with:
- `success` (bool): Whether merge succeeded
- `message` (str): Human-readable result message
- `settings_path` (Optional[str]): Path to merged settings file
- `hooks_added` (int): Number of hooks added from template
- `hooks_preserved` (int): Number of existing hooks preserved
- `details` (Dict[str, Any]): Additional context (errors, warnings)

**Workflow**:
1. Validate both paths (security: CWE-22, CWE-59)
2. Read template and user settings files
3. Deep merge dictionaries (nested objects preserved)
4. Merge hooks by lifecycle event (avoid duplicates)
5. Atomic write to user path (secure permissions 0o600)
6. Audit log the operation

**Example**:
```python
from autonomous_dev.lib.settings_merger import SettingsMerger

merger = SettingsMerger(project_root="/path/to/project")

# Merge template with user settings
result = merger.merge_settings(
    template_path=Path("templates/settings.local.json"),
    user_path=Path(".claude/settings.local.json"),
    write_result=True
)

if result.success:
    print(f"Merged {result.hooks_added} new hooks")
    print(f"Preserved {result.hooks_preserved} existing hooks")
else:
    print(f"Merge failed: {result.message}")
```

### Data Classes

#### `MergeResult`

Result of settings merge operation.

**Attributes**:
- `success` (bool): Whether merge succeeded
- `message` (str): Human-readable result message
- `settings_path` (Optional[str]): Path to merged settings file (None if merge failed)
- `hooks_added` (int): Number of hooks added from template
- `hooks_preserved` (int): Number of existing hooks preserved
- `details` (Dict[str, Any]): Additional result details (errors, warnings)

### Security Features

**Path Validation**:
- Validates both template and user paths against project root
- Blocks path traversal attacks (CWE-22)
- Rejects symlinks and suspicious paths (CWE-59)
- Uses `security_utils.validate_path()` for comprehensive validation

**Atomic Writes**:
- Creates temp file in same directory as target
- Sets secure permissions (0o600 - user read/write only)
- Atomic rename to target path (POSIX-safe)
- Cleans up temp files on error

**Audit Logging**:
- All operations logged via `security_utils.audit_log()`
- Tracks merge success/failure with context
- Records path validation decisions
- Enables security audits and compliance

**Deep Merge Logic**:
- Nested dictionaries merged recursively (preserves structure)
- Lists replaced, not merged (prevents duplicate items)
- Special handling for hooks: merge by lifecycle event
- User customizations always preserved

### Integration with sync_dispatcher.py

Used by `SyncDispatcher.sync_marketplace()` to automatically merge PreToolUse hooks:

**Workflow**:
1. Marketplace sync starts
2. Locate plugin's template settings.local.json
3. Create SettingsMerger instance
4. Call `merge_settings()` with template and user paths
5. Record merge result in `SyncResult.settings_merged`
6. Continue sync (non-blocking if merge fails)

**Example**:
```python
from autonomous_dev.lib.sync_dispatcher import SyncDispatcher

dispatcher = SyncDispatcher(project_root="/path/to/project")
result = dispatcher.sync_marketplace(installed_plugins_path)

if result.settings_merged and result.settings_merged.success:
    print(f"Settings synced: {result.settings_merged.hooks_added} hooks added")
```

### Error Handling

All errors are graceful and non-blocking:

**Template Errors**:
- Template path validation fails: Return MergeResult with `success=False`
- Template file not found: Return MergeResult with `success=False`
- Template JSON invalid: Return MergeResult with `success=False`

**User Settings Errors**:
- User path validation fails: Return MergeResult with `success=False`
- User settings JSON invalid: Return MergeResult with `success=False`
- User settings file missing: Create new file from template (success=True)

**Write Errors**:
- Cannot create parent directories: Return MergeResult with `success=False`
- File write fails: Return MergeResult with `success=False` (temp file cleaned up)
- Permission denied: Return MergeResult with `success=False`

**Note**: Marketplace sync continues even if settings merge fails (non-blocking design)

### Testing

**Test Coverage**: 25 tests (15 core + 4 edge cases + 3 security + 3 integration)
- Core functionality tests for merge operations
- Edge case handling (missing files, invalid JSON, path errors)
- Security tests (path traversal, symlink attacks, validation)
- Integration tests with sync_dispatcher

##### `detect_conflicts(target_dir: Path | str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`

Detect conflicts between staged files and target directory.

A conflict occurs when:
- File exists in both locations
- File content differs (different hashes)

**Parameters**:
- `target_dir` (Path | str): Target directory to compare against

**Returns**: List of conflict dicts with file, reason, staging_hash, target_hash

**Raises**:
- `ValueError`: If path contains traversal (..), is absolute, or is a symlink

### Security Features

**Path Traversal Prevention**:
- Blocks paths containing `..`
- Rejects absolute paths
- Validates paths are within staging directory (CWE-22)

**Symlink Detection**:
- Prevents symlink-based attacks (CWE-59)
- Validates resolved path is within staging directory

**File Hashing**:
- SHA256 for content comparison
- Enables conflict detection without loading full file contents

### Testing

**Test Coverage**: 18 tests

**Parameters**:
- `output_path` (Path): Path to write settings.local.json
- `merge_existing` (bool): Whether to merge with existing settings (preserves customizations)
- `backup` (bool): Whether to backup existing file before overwrite

**Returns**: `GeneratorResult` dataclass

**Workflow**:
1. Validate output path (security checks)
2. Create .claude/ directory if missing (with secure permissions)
3. Backup existing file if requested
4. Read and merge with existing settings if requested
5. Generate new settings dictionary
6. Atomic write with secure permissions (0o600)
7. Audit log the operation

**Example**:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from autonomous_dev.lib.settings_generator import SettingsGenerator

generator = SettingsGenerator(Path("plugins/autonomous-dev"))

# Fresh install
result = generator.write_settings(
    output_path=Path(".claude/settings.local.json")
)

# Upgrade with merge and backup
result = generator.write_settings(
    output_path=Path(".claude/settings.local.json"),

    backup=True
)

if result.success:
    print(f"Settings written: {result.patterns_added} patterns")
    print(f"Preserved: {result.patterns_preserved} user patterns")
```


##### `validate_permission_patterns(settings: Dict) -> ValidationResult` (v3.44.0+, Issue #114)

Validate permission patterns in settings for dangerous wildcards and missing deny list.

**Parameters**:
- `settings` (Dict): Settings dictionary to validate

**Returns**: `ValidationResult` dataclass with detected issues

**Detects**:
- **Bash(*) wildcard** → severity "error" (too permissive, approves all Bash commands)
- **Bash(:*) wildcard** → severity "warning" (rare edge case, usually unintended)
- **Missing deny list** → severity "error" (no protection against dangerous commands)
- **Empty deny list** → severity "error" (no protection against dangerous commands)

**Example**:
```python
from settings_generator import validate_permission_patterns

# Settings with dangerous patterns
settings = {
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Bash(*)", "Read(**)"],
        "deny": []
    }
}

result = validate_permission_patterns(settings)
if not result.valid:
    for issue in result.issues:
        print(f"{issue.severity.upper()}: {issue.description}")
        # ERROR: Dangerous wildcard pattern detected: Bash(*)
        # ERROR: Deny list is empty - no protection against dangerous commands

# Clean settings
good_settings = {
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Bash(git:*)", "Read(**)"],
        "deny": ["Bash(rm:-rf*)", "Bash(sudo:*)"]
    }
}

result = validate_permission_patterns(good_settings)
print(result.valid)  # True
```

**Related**: GitHub Issue #114 (Permission validation during updates)

##### `fix_permission_patterns(user_settings: Dict, template_settings: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Dict` (v3.44.0+, Issue #114)

Fix permission patterns while preserving user customizations.

**Parameters**:
- `user_settings` (Dict): User's existing settings to fix
- `template_settings` (Optional[Dict]): Template settings (unused, for compatibility)

**Returns**: Fixed settings dictionary

**Raises**:
- `ValueError`: If user_settings is None or not a dictionary

**Process**:
1. Preserve user hooks (don't touch)
2. Preserve valid custom allow patterns (non-wildcard patterns)
3. Replace wildcards with specific patterns (Bash(*) → Bash(git:*), Bash(pytest:*), etc.)
4. Add comprehensive deny list if missing
5. Validate result

**Example**:
```python
from settings_generator import fix_permission_patterns

# User settings with dangerous wildcards
user_settings = {
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Bash(*)", "MyCustomPattern"],  # Has wildcard + custom
        "deny": []
    },
    "hooks": {
        "my_custom_hook": "path/to/hook.py"
    }
}

# Fix patterns
fixed = fix_permission_patterns(user_settings)

# Result preserves customizations:
# - "MyCustomPattern" kept (valid custom pattern)
# - "Bash(*)" replaced with specific patterns
# - Deny list added
# - Hooks preserved
print(fixed["permissions"]["allow"])
# ['MyCustomPattern', 'Bash(git:*)', 'Bash(pytest:*)', 'Read(**)', ...]

print(fixed["hooks"])
# {'my_custom_hook': 'path/to/hook.py'}  # Preserved!
```

**Preservation Logic**:
- **Hooks**: Always preserved (user customization)
- **Valid patterns**: Preserved if not Bash(*) or Bash(:*)
- **Wildcards**: Replaced with safe specific patterns
- **Deny list**: Added if missing (50+ dangerous patterns)

**Related**: GitHub Issue #114 (Permission fixing during updates)

##### `merge_global_settings(global_path: Path, template_path: Path, fix_wildcards: bool = True, create_backup: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]` (v3.46.0+, Issue #117)

Merge global settings preserving user customizations while fixing broken patterns.

**Purpose**: Merge template settings with existing user settings, fixing broken Bash(:*) patterns while preserving user hooks and custom patterns. Used during plugin installation/update to safely merge new patterns.

**Parameters**:
- `global_path` (Path): Path to global settings file (~/.claude/settings.json)
- `template_path` (Path): Path to template file (plugins/autonomous-dev/config/global_settings_template.json)
- `fix_wildcards` (bool): Whether to fix broken wildcard patterns (default: True)
- `create_backup` (bool): Whether to create backup before modification (default: True)

**Returns**: Merged settings dictionary ready for use

**Raises**:
- `SettingsGeneratorError`: If template not found, template invalid JSON, or write fails

**Process**:
1. Validate template exists and is valid JSON
2. Read existing user settings from global_path (if exists)
3. Detect broken patterns in user settings (Bash(:*))
4. Fix broken patterns: Bash(:*) to [Bash(git:*), Bash(python:*), ...]
5. Deep merge: template patterns + user patterns (union)
6. Preserve user hooks completely (never modified)
7. Backup existing file before writing (if create_backup=True)
8. Write merged settings atomically with secure permissions
9. Audit log all operations

**Merge Strategy**:
- **Template**: Source of truth for safe patterns
- **User settings**: Provides customizations and valid patterns
- **Merge result**: Union of all patterns (template + user)
- **User hooks**: Always preserved unchanged
- **Wildcard fix**: Broken patterns replaced, valid patterns kept

**Example**:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from autonomous_dev.lib.settings_generator import SettingsGenerator

generator = SettingsGenerator(Path("plugins/autonomous-dev"))

# Merge global settings with user customizations
merged_settings = generator.merge_global_settings(
    global_path=Path.home() / ".claude" / "settings.json",
    template_path=Path("plugins/autonomous-dev/config/global_settings_template.json"),
    fix_wildcards=True,
    create_backup=True
)

print(f"Merged settings: {merged_settings}")
print(f"Patterns available: {len(merged_settings.get('allowedTools', {}).get('Bash', {}).get('allow_patterns', []))} allows")
```

**Backup Behavior**:
- Creates ~/.claude/settings.json.backup before modifying existing file
- Only creates backup if file exists and will be modified
- Old backup automatically replaced (one backup per merge)
- Corrupted files backed up as .json.corrupted with automatic regeneration

**Error Recovery**:
- **Missing template**: Raises SettingsGeneratorError with helpful message
- **Invalid template JSON**: Raises SettingsGeneratorError with JSON error details
- **Permission denied**: Raises PermissionError (allows testing/handling in caller)
- **Write failure**: Cleans up temp file and raises SettingsGeneratorError
- **Corrupted user file**: Creates .json.corrupted backup and starts fresh

**Security**:
- Atomic writes: Tempfile in same directory + atomic rename prevents corruption
- Secure permissions: 0o600 (user read/write only)
- Path validation: All paths validated against CWE-22 (path traversal), CWE-59 (symlinks)
- Audit logging: All operations logged with context

**Related**: GitHub Issue #117 (Global Settings Configuration - Merge Broken Patterns)

## 43. protected_file_detector.py (316 lines, v3.41.0+)

**Purpose**: Detect user artifacts and protected files during installation

**Issue**: #106 (GenAI-first installation system)

### Overview

The protected file detector identifies files that should NOT be overwritten during installation. This includes:
- User configuration files (.env, PROJECT.md)
- State files (batch state, session state)
- Custom hooks created by users
- Modified plugin files (detected by hash comparison)

**Key Features**:
- Always-protected file list (hardcoded critical files)
- Custom hook detection (glob patterns)
- Plugin default comparison (hash-based)
- Flexible glob pattern matching
- File categorization (config, state, custom_hook, modified_plugin)

### Setup-Wizard Phase 0 Workflow

Orchestrates 6-step installation process:

1. **Phase 0.1**: Check for staging directory
   - Call: `check_staging(staging_path)`
   - If fallback_needed: Skip to Phase 1

2. **Phase 0.2**: Analyze installation type
   - Call: `analyze_installation_type(project_path)`
   - Display analysis to user (type, protected files)

3. **Phase 0.3**: Execute installation
   - Call: `execute_installation(staging_path, project_path, type)`
   - Display progress (files copied, skipped, backups)

4. **Phase 0.4**: Validate critical directories exist
   - Verify: plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/
   - Verify: plugins/autonomous-dev/agents/
   - Verify: plugins/autonomous-dev/hooks/
   - Verify: plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/
   - Verify: plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/
   - Verify: .claude/

5. **Phase 0.5**: Generate summary
   - Call: `generate_summary(type, result, project_path)`
   - Display summary and next steps

6. **Phase 0.6**: Cleanup staging
   - Call: `cleanup_staging(staging_path)`
   - Remove staging directory

**Error Recovery**: Any step failure falls back to Phase 1 (manual setup) without data loss

### Integration Points

**Uses**:
- `staging_manager.py`: Check directory validity, list files
- `installation_analyzer.py`: Analyze installation type
- `protected_file_detector.py`: Identify protected files
- `copy_system.py`: Execute file copying with protection
- `install_audit.py`: Record all operations in audit trail

**Called By**:
- `setup-wizard.md` (Phase 0 workflow)

### Security Features

**Path Traversal Prevention (CWE-22)**:
- Validates all paths before operations
- Rejects paths with `../` sequences
- Uses `Path.resolve()` for absolute path validation

**Symlink Attack Prevention (CWE-59)**:
- Detects symlinks via `is_symlink()`
- Validates resolved targets are within project

**Protected File Detection**:
- ALWAYS_PROTECTED list: .env, .claude/PROJECT.md, .claude/batch_state.json, etc.
- Custom detection for user hooks via glob patterns
- Hash-based detection for modified plugin files

**Audit Logging**:
- All operations logged in `.claude/install_audit.jsonl`
- Enables forensic analysis and debugging
- Supports recovery from crashes

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- CLI failures do not interrupt setup wizard
- Phase 0 failures fall back to Phase 1 (manual setup)
- Non-blocking: Errors return status field for agent decision-making

**JSON Error Format**:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Error message",
  "command": "command_name"
}
```

### Usage Examples

**Check Staging**:
```bash
python genai_install_wrapper.py check-staging "$HOME/.autonomous-dev-staging"
```

**Analyze Project**:
```bash
python genai_install_wrapper.py analyze "$(pwd)"
```

**Execute Installation**:
```bash
python genai_install_wrapper.py execute \
  "$HOME/.autonomous-dev-staging" \
  "$(pwd)" \
  "fresh"
```

**Generate Summary**:
```bash
python genai_install_wrapper.py summary \
  "fresh" \
  "/tmp/install_result.json" \
  "$(pwd)"
```

**Cleanup**:
```bash
python genai_install_wrapper.py cleanup "$HOME/.autonomous-dev-staging"
```

### Design Patterns

**Non-Blocking CLI**:
- All commands return JSON
- Failures are graceful (do not crash wrapper)
- Agent can decide next action based on status field

**Atomic Commands**:
- Each command is independent
- Can be retried safely
- Idempotent operations (cleanup can run multiple times)

**Integration Layer**:
- Wraps core installation libraries
- Orchestrates workflow steps
- Provides human-friendly output templates

### Testing

**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive integration tests

**Scenarios**:
- Phase 0 complete workflow (all 6 steps)
- Missing staging directory (fallback to Phase 1)
- Invalid installation types (error handling)
- Protected file preservation (brownfield/upgrade)
- Backup creation for upgrades
- Error recovery and audit trail

## 49. configure_global_settings.py (CLI Wrapper, v3.46.0+, Issue #116)

**Purpose**: Configure fresh installs and upgrades with ~/.claude/settings.json permission patterns

**Called By**: `install.sh` during bootstrap Phase 1 (fresh install, updates, upgrades)

**Status**: Production (integrated into install.sh bootstrap workflow)

### Overview

CLI wrapper for `SettingsGenerator.merge_global_settings()`. Creates or updates `~/.claude/settings.json` with correct permission patterns for Claude Code 2.0. Handles both fresh installs (create from template) and upgrades (preserve user customizations while fixing broken patterns).

### Key Features

1. **Fresh Install**: Creates `~/.claude/settings.json` from template on first install
2. **Upgrade Path**: Preserves user customizations while fixing broken `Bash(:*)` patterns
3. **Non-Blocking**: Always exits 0 for graceful degradation (installation continues even on errors)
4. **Backup Safety**: Creates timestamped backup before modifying existing files
5. **JSON Output**: Returns structured status JSON for `install.sh` consumption
6. **Atomic Writes**: Uses tempfile + rename for safe file operations
7. **Directory Creation**: Creates `~/.claude/` if missing with secure permissions

### Command-Line Interface

**Basic Usage**:
```bash
# Fresh install (no existing settings)
python3 configure_global_settings.py --template /path/to/template.json

# Upgrade (existing settings, preserve customizations)
python3 configure_global_settings.py --template /path/to/template.json --home ~/.claude
```

**Arguments**:
- `--template PATH`: Path to settings template file (required)
  - Typically: `plugins/autonomous-dev/config/global_settings_template.json`
  - Must be valid JSON with `permissions` object
- `--home PATH`: Path to home directory (optional, default: `~/.claude`)
  - Rarely used, for testing with different directories

### Output Format

**Success Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": true,
  "message": "Created ~/.claude/settings.json from template",
  "path": "~/.claude/settings.json",
  "permissions": 384,
  "patterns_added": 45,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-13T15:30:45.123456"
}
```

**Upgrade Response** (preserving customizations):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "created": false,
  "message": "Updated ~/.claude/settings.json (preserved customizations)",
  "path": "~/.claude/settings.json",
  "backup_path": "~/.claude/settings.json.backup.20251213_153045",
  "patterns_fixed": 2,
  "patterns_preserved": 5,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-13T15:30:45.123456"
}
```

**Error Response** (non-blocking):
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "created": false,
  "message": "Template file not found: /path/to/template.json",
  "path": null,
  "timestamp": "2025-12-13T15:30:45.123456"
}
```

**Exit Code**: Always 0 (non-blocking - installation continues)

### Integration with install.sh

Called from `install.sh` after downloading plugin files to configure global settings.

**Related Files**:
- `plugins/autonomous-dev/config/global_settings_template.json` - Template source
- `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/settings_generator.py` - Python API
- `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/validation.py` - Path validation
- `tests/unit/scripts/test_configure_global_settings.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_install_settings_configuration.py` - Integration tests

### Configuration Processing

**Fresh Install Workflow**:
1. Check if template exists and is valid JSON
2. Create `~/.claude/` directory if missing (permissions: 0o700)
3. Merge template with empty user settings
4. Write merged settings to `~/.claude/settings.json` (permissions: 0o600)
5. Return JSON with `created: true`

**Upgrade Workflow**:
1. Check if template exists and is valid JSON
2. Read existing `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Detect broken patterns (e.g., `Bash(:*)`)
4. Fix broken patterns: Replace `Bash(:*)` with safe specific patterns
5. Deep merge: template patterns + user patterns (union)
6. Preserve user hooks completely (never modified)
7. Create backup: `settings.json.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
8. Write merged settings atomically
9. Return JSON with `created: false`, backup path, and fix count

### Security

**Input Validation**:
- Path validation (CWE-22, CWE-59): Prevent path traversal, symlink attacks
- Template validation: Must be valid JSON
- Home directory validation: Must be under home directory

**Output Safety**:
- Atomic writes: Tempfile + rename pattern
- Secure permissions: 0o600 for settings (user-only access)
- No credential exposure in JSON output

**Backup Safety**:
- Timestamped filenames: `settings.json.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Only created if file will be modified
- Secure permissions: 0o600 (user-only access)
- Old backups automatically replaced (one backup per session)

### Error Handling

All errors are non-blocking (exit 0) for graceful degradation:

| Error | Message | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Template not found | "Template file not found: ..." | Returns error JSON, continues installation |
| Invalid template JSON | "Template is invalid JSON: ..." | Returns error JSON, continues installation |
| Permission denied (read) | "Cannot read template: ..." | Returns error JSON, continues installation |
| Permission denied (write) | "Cannot write settings: ..." | Returns error JSON, continues installation |
| Corrupted settings.json | "Settings file corrupted: ..." | Backs up corrupted file, creates fresh copy |
| Path traversal attempt | "Invalid path: ..." | Rejected, continues installation |

Installation Impact: Non-blocking errors allow installation to continue. Manual configuration may be needed if settings.json not created.

### Testing

**Test Coverage**: 19 tests across 2 files

**Unit Tests** (11 tests):
- Fresh install creates settings from template

## 43. skill_loader.py (320 lines, v3.43.0+, Issue #140)

**Purpose**: Load and inject skill content into subagent prompts spawned via Task tool.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/skill_loader.py`

**Problem Solved**: Subagents spawned via Task tool do not inherit skills from the main conversation. Skills must be explicitly injected into Task prompts.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Load skills for an agent
python3 plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/skill_loader.py implementer

# List available skills
python3 plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/skill_loader.py --list

# Show agent-skill mapping
python3 plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/skill_loader.py --map
```

### Core Functions

#### `load_skills_for_agent(agent_name: str) -> Dict[str, str]`

Load all relevant skills for an agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agent_name` (str): Name of the agent (e.g., "implementer")

**Returns**: Dict mapping skill names to their content

#### `format_skills_for_prompt(skills: Dict[str, str], max_total_lines: int = 1500) -> str`

Format loaded skills as XML tags for prompt injection.

**Parameters**:
- `skills` (Dict[str, str]): Dict mapping skill names to content
- `max_total_lines` (int): Maximum total lines across all skills (default 1500)

**Returns**: Formatted string with skills in XML tags

#### `get_skill_injection_for_agent(agent_name: str) -> str`

Convenience function to get formatted skill injection for an agent.

**Parameters**:
- `agent_name` (str): Name of the agent

**Returns**: Formatted skill content ready for prompt injection

### Agent-Skill Mapping

| Agent | Skills |
|-------|--------|
| test-master | testing-guide, python-standards |
| implementer | python-standards, testing-guide, error-handling-patterns |
| reviewer | code-review, python-standards |
| security-auditor | security-patterns, error-handling-patterns |
| doc-master | documentation-guide, git-workflow |
| planner | architecture-patterns, project-management |

### Security Features

- **Trusted Directory Only**: Skills loaded from `plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/` only
- **No Path Traversal**: Rejects skill names with `/`, `\`, or `..`
- **Text Injection Only**: Skill content is not executed, only injected as text
- **Audit Logging**: Missing skills logged to stderr for debugging

### Integration with auto-implement.md

The `/implement` command uses skill_loader.py before each Task call:

```markdown
**SKILL INJECTION** (Issue #140): Before calling Task, load skills:
\`\`\`bash
python3 plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/skill_loader.py test-master
\`\`\`
Prepend the output to the prompt below.
```

### Related Components

**Imports**:
- `path_utils.get_project_root()` - Project root detection

**Used By**:
- `auto-implement.md` - Skill injection before Task calls

**Related Issues**:
- GitHub Issue #140 - Skills not available to subagents

## 50. context_skill_injector.py (320 lines, v3.47.0+, Issue #154)

**Purpose**: Auto-inject relevant skills based on conversation context patterns, not just agent frontmatter declarations.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/context_skill_injector.py`

**Problem Solved**: Agents with fixed skill_loader mappings miss skills relevant to dynamic user prompts. Pattern-based detection enables adaptive skill injection that responds to actual conversation context.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Detect patterns in a prompt
python3 plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/context_skill_injector.py "implement secure API endpoint"

# Typical output:
# Prompt: implement secure API endpoint
# Detected patterns: {'security', 'api'}
# Selected skills: ['security-patterns', 'api-design', 'api-integration-patterns']
```

### Core Functions

#### `detect_context_patterns(user_prompt: Optional[str]) -> Set[str]`

Detect context patterns in user prompt using regex matching.

**Parameters**:
- `user_prompt` (str): User's prompt text

**Returns**: Set of pattern category names (e.g., {"security", "api"})

**Pattern Categories**:
- `security` - auth, tokens, passwords, JWT, encryption
- `api` - REST endpoints, HTTP methods, webhooks
- `database` - SQL, migrations, schemas, ORMs
- `git` - commits, branches, pull requests
- `testing` - unit tests, pytest, TDD, mocks
- `python` - type hints, docstrings, PEP standards

#### `select_skills_for_context(user_prompt: Optional[str], max_skills: int = 5) -> List[str]`

Select relevant skills based on detected context patterns.

**Parameters**:
- `user_prompt` (str): User's prompt text
- `max_skills` (int): Maximum number of skills to return (default: 5)

**Returns**: Prioritized list of skill names limited to max_skills

**Priority Order**: Security → Testing → API → Database → Python → Git

#### `get_context_skill_injection(user_prompt: Optional[str], max_skills: int = 5) -> str`

Main entry point: combine pattern detection, skill selection, and skill loading.

**Parameters**:
- `user_prompt` (str): User's prompt text
- `max_skills` (int): Maximum number of skills to inject

**Returns**: Formatted skill content string (XML-tagged) or empty string

### Usage Example

```python
from context_skill_injector import get_context_skill_injection

# Automatically select and load skills based on prompt
prompt = "implement JWT authentication with secure password hashing"
skill_content = get_context_skill_injection(prompt)

# Returns security-patterns skill (detected: "JWT", "auth", "password")
# Max 5 skills injected to prevent context bloat
```

### Pattern Detection

Patterns use case-insensitive regex with word boundaries to avoid partial matches:

```python
CONTEXT_PATTERNS = {
    "security": [
        r"\b(auth|authenticat\w*|authoriz\w*)\b",
        r"\b(token|jwt|oauth|api.?key)\b",
        r"\b(password|secret|credential|encrypt)\b",
        # ... more patterns
    ],
    # ... other categories
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Latency**: <100ms for pattern detection (regex, not LLM)
- **Context Impact**: 5 skills × 50-100 lines each = 250-500 tokens (controllable)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing skills don't block workflow (returns empty string)

### Integration Points

**Imports**:
- `skill_loader.load_skill_content()` - Load actual skill files
- `skill_loader.format_skills_for_prompt()` - Format for injection

**Used By**:
- Agent prompts (future) - Can augment skill_loader agent-based injection
- Custom commands - Can use for dynamic skill selection

### Security Features

- **Trusted Directory Only**: Skills loaded from `plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/` only
- **No LLM**: Pattern detection via regex only (deterministic, auditable)
- **Text Injection Only**: Skill content is not executed, only injected
- **Limited Context**: Max 5 skills prevents unbounded context growth

### Related Components

**Depends On**:
- `skill_loader.py` - Load and format skill content
- `CONTEXT_PATTERNS` dict - Regex patterns for detection
- `PATTERN_SKILL_MAP` dict - Pattern-to-skill mappings

**Related Issues**:
- GitHub Issue #154 - Context-triggered skill injection
- GitHub Issue #140 - Skills not available to subagents (related work)
- GitHub Issue #35 - Agents should actively use skills (related goal)

    "dependent_features": 2,      # Features with dependencies
    "max_depth": 2,              # Longest dependency chain
    "total_features": 3,
}
```

### Security

**Input Validation** (CWE-22, CWE-78):
- Text sanitization via validation.sanitize_text_input() (max 10,000 chars per feature)
- No shell execution
- Path traversal protection via safe regex matching
- Command injection prevention - only text analysis

**Resource Limits**:
- MAX_FEATURES: 1000 (prevents unbounded processing)
- TIMEOUT_SECONDS: 5 (prevents infinite loops in circular detection)
- Memory: O(V + E) for graph storage (linear in feature count)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Analysis Time**: <100ms for typical batches (50 features)
- **Memory**: O(V + E) where V = features, E = dependencies
- **Topological Sort**: O(V + E) via Kahn's algorithm
- **Circular Detection**: O(V + E) via DFS
- **Graph Visualization**: O(V + E) for ASCII rendering

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:

## 51. genai_manifest_validator.py (474 lines, v3.44.0+ - Issue #160)

**Purpose**: GenAI-powered manifest alignment validation using Claude Sonnet 4.5 with structured output.

**Module**: plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/genai_manifest_validator.py

**Problem Solved**:
- Manual CLAUDE.md updates may create drift between documented component counts and actual manifest
- Regex-only validation misses semantic inconsistencies and version conflicts
- Need LLM reasoning to catch complex alignment issues

**Solution**:
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 with structured JSON output for manifest validation
- Validates manifest (plugin.json) against documentation (CLAUDE.md)
- Detects count mismatches, version drift, missing components, inconsistent configurations
- Returns None when API key absent (enables fallback to regex validator)
- Supports both Anthropic and OpenRouter API keys for flexibility

### Core Classes

#### ManifestIssue
Represents a single manifest alignment issue with severity level.

#### IssueLevel
Enum for validation issue severity levels with ERROR, WARNING, and INFO levels.

#### ManifestValidationResult
Complete validation result with component breakdown, counts, versions, and timestamp.

#### GenAIManifestValidator
Main validator class using Claude Sonnet 4.5 with structured output.

### API Reference

#### GenAIManifestValidator.validate()

Main validation entry point.

**Returns**: Optional[ManifestValidationResult]
- ManifestValidationResult on successful validation
- None if API key missing (graceful fallback)

**Raises**:
- json.JSONDecodeError - If plugin.json is malformed
- FileNotFoundError - If plugin.json or CLAUDE.md not found
- Exception - If API call fails (will be caught and logged)

**Security**:
- Path validation via security_utils (CWE-22, CWE-59)
- Token budget enforcement (max 8K tokens)
- API key never logged
- Input sanitization

### Validation Checks

GenAI validator checks for:
1. Count Mismatches: Documented vs actual component counts
2. Version Drift: Documented versions vs manifest versions
3. Missing Components: Components in manifest but not documented
4. Undocumented Components: Components documented but not in manifest
5. Configuration Inconsistencies: Settings conflicts between manifest and docs
6. Dependency Issues: Component dependencies that cannot be satisfied

### LLM Reasoning

Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for semantic validation:
- Understands natural language descriptions in CLAUDE.md
- Detects logical inconsistencies (e.g., documented 8 agents but manifest shows 7)
- Catches version mismatches across multiple files
- Identifies scope creep (features documented but not implemented)
- Validates architectural claims against actual implementation

### API Support

**Primary API**: Anthropic (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

**Fallback API**: OpenRouter (OPENROUTER_API_KEY)

### Security

**Input Validation** (CWE-22, CWE-59):
- Path validation via security_utils.validate_path()
- Only allows project root and system temp directories
- Symlink resolution and normalization

**Token Budget**:
- MAX_TOKENS = 8000
- Enforced in prompt construction
- Prevents runaway API costs

**API Key Handling**:
- Keys read from environment only
- Never logged or exposed in output
- Graceful degradation if missing

**Data Handling**:
- No sensitive data in audit logs
- Results include only validation metadata
- No raw file contents in output

### Performance Characteristics

- API Latency: 5-15 seconds (Anthropic/OpenRouter)
- Local Processing: less than 100ms
- Total Time: 5-15 seconds per validation
- Token Usage: 2-4K tokens typical (within 8K budget)
- Memory: less than 50MB

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- API key missing: Returns None (signals fallback)
- API call fails: Logs error, returns None
- Invalid JSON: Raises JSONDecodeError (should be caught by hybrid validator)
- File not found: Returns None (signals regex fallback)
- Token budget exceeded: Truncates input gracefully

### Test Coverage

**Test File**: tests/unit/lib/test_genai_manifest_validator.py

**Coverage Areas**:
- API key detection (Anthropic, OpenRouter, missing)
- Manifest loading and validation
- CLAUDE.md parsing
- Count mismatch detection
- Version drift detection
- Missing component detection
- Prompt construction with token budget
- LLM response parsing
- Error handling (missing files, invalid JSON)
- Security validations (path traversal, injection)
- Graceful degradation

**Target**: 85 percent coverage

### Used By

- hybrid_validator.py - Primary GenAI validator (tries first, falls back if no API key)
- /health-check command - Optional GenAI validation if API key available
- CI/CD validation - For GenAI-powered alignment checks

### Related Issues

- GitHub Issue #160 - GenAI manifest alignment validation
- GitHub Issue #148 - Claude Code 2.0 compliance
- GitHub Issue #146 - Tool least privilege enforcement

### Related Components

**Dependencies**:
- security_utils.py - Path validation and audit logging
- anthropic package (optional) - Anthropic API
- openai package (optional) - OpenRouter API via OpenAI client

**Used By**:
- hybrid_validator.py - Orchestrator that wraps this validator

### Fallback Mechanism

GenAI validator is designed to fail gracefully. When API key is missing, it returns None which signals the hybrid validator to fall back to regex validation. This enables LLM-powered validation in environments with API keys while maintaining regex-based validation for users without them.

---

## 52. hybrid_validator.py (378 lines, v3.44.0+ - Issue #160)

**Purpose**: Orchestrates GenAI and regex manifest validation with automatic fallback.

**Module**: plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/hybrid_validator.py

**Problem Solved**:
- Users with API keys get LLM-powered validation (better accuracy)
- Users without API keys get regex validation (still catches issues)
- Need unified API for both approaches

**Solution**:
- Three validation modes: AUTO (default), GENAI_ONLY, REGEX_ONLY
- AUTO mode tries GenAI first, falls back to regex if API key missing
- Returns consistent HybridValidationReport format
- Used by /health-check and CI/CD validation pipelines

### Core Classes

#### ValidationMode
Enum for validation execution modes with AUTO, GENAI_ONLY, and REGEX_ONLY values.

#### HybridValidationReport
Extended validation report with hybrid metadata tracking which validator was used.

#### HybridManifestValidator
Main validator orchestrator with mode-specific behavior.

### API Reference

#### HybridManifestValidator.__init__()

Initialize validator with mode selection.

**Parameters**:
- repo_root (Path): Repository root directory
- mode (ValidationMode): Validation mode (default: AUTO)

**Raises**:
- ValueError - If repo_root invalid or outside allowed locations

#### HybridManifestValidator.validate()

Main validation entry point with mode-specific behavior.

**Returns**: HybridValidationReport
- Always returns a report (never None)
- validator_used field indicates which backend was used

**Raises**:
- RuntimeError - Only in GENAI_ONLY mode if no API key
- FileNotFoundError - If required files missing

### Validation Modes

#### AUTO Mode (Default)

Strategy: LLM first, regex fallback

1. Try GenAI: Attempt validation with Claude Sonnet 4.5
2. Success Path: Return GenAI result (validator_used="genai")
3. Fallback Path: If API key missing, use regex validation
4. Final Result: Always returns HybridValidationReport

Best For: Production environments where API key may be available

#### GENAI_ONLY Mode

Strategy: Strict LLM validation

1. Check API Key: Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY
2. Fail if Missing: Raise RuntimeError
3. Validate: Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 validation

Best For: CI/CD pipelines that require LLM-powered validation

#### REGEX_ONLY Mode

Strategy: Pattern-based validation

1. Use Regex: Validate with pattern matching (no API call)
2. Return Result: Always succeeds (validator_used="regex")

Best For: Quick validation without API latency, offline environments

### Validation Report

All modes return HybridValidationReport with:
- validator_used: "genai" or "regex"
- version_issues: Version mismatches
- count_issues: Count discrepancies
- cross_reference_issues: Missing references
- error_count: Number of errors
- warning_count: Number of warnings
- info_count: Number of info messages
- is_valid: True if error_count equals zero

### Security

**Input Validation** (CWE-22, CWE-59):
- Path validation via security_utils.validate_path()
- Repository root must be within project boundaries
- No path traversal allowed

**API Key Handling**:
- Keys read from environment only
- Never exposed in output or logs
- Missing key triggers graceful fallback (AUTO mode)

**Data Flow**:
- GenAI validator: Processes manifest and docs, returns issues
- Regex validator: Pattern matching only, no LLM calls
- Report: Contains only validation metadata, no sensitive data

### Performance Characteristics

**AUTO Mode**:
- With API Key: 5-15 seconds (GenAI latency)
- Without API Key: less than 1 second (regex fallback)
- Typical: 1-3 seconds (regex)

**GENAI_ONLY Mode**:
- With API Key: 5-15 seconds
- Without API Key: RuntimeError (fails immediately)

**REGEX_ONLY Mode**:
- Always: less than 1 second
- Memory: less than 10MB

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- AUTO mode: Missing API key -> Falls back to regex
- GENAI_ONLY mode: Missing API key -> Raises RuntimeError
- REGEX_ONLY mode: Always succeeds (worst case: minimal validation)
- Invalid paths: Raises ValueError early (before validation)
- Missing files: Returns report with errors (no exception)

### Test Coverage

**Test File**: tests/unit/lib/test_hybrid_validator.py

**Coverage Areas**:
- Mode selection (AUTO, GENAI_ONLY, REGEX_ONLY)
- API key detection and fallback
- GenAI validation integration

#### clear_state_on_success() -> bool

Delete state file after successful completion.

**Returns**: True if cleared or doesn't exist, False if error

**Features**:
- Idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
- Graceful degradation on permission errors

#### get_state() -> Optional[LoopBackState]

Alias for `get_retry_state()` for consistency with other APIs.

**Returns**: `LoopBackState` if exists, None otherwise

### Configuration Constants

```python
# Expected agents in pipeline order (8 total)
EXPECTED_AGENTS = [
    "researcher-local",
    "researcher-web",
    "planner",
    "test-master",
    "implementer",
    "reviewer",
    "security-auditor",
    "doc-master"
]

# Retry configuration
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 3
BASE_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 100
BACKOFF_BASE_MS = 100
BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2
BACKOFF_MAX_MS = 5000
```

### Usage Example

Basic verification with retry logic:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from completion_verifier import CompletionVerifier, should_retry
import time

# Initialize verifier
verifier = CompletionVerifier(session_id="session_123")

# Check if complete
result = verifier.verify()
if result.complete:
    print(f"Pipeline complete: {len(result.agents_found)} agents")
    verifier.clear_state_on_success()
else:
    print(f"Missing agents: {result.missing_agents}")

    # Load or create retry state
    state = verifier.get_retry_state()
    if state is None:
        # First check - create new state
        from completion_verifier import create_loop_back_checkpoint
        create_loop_back_checkpoint("session_123", result.missing_agents, Path(".claude"))
        state = verifier.get_retry_state()

    # Check if should retry
    if should_retry(state):
        # Wait with exponential backoff
        from completion_verifier import get_next_retry_delay
        delay_ms = get_next_retry_delay(state.attempt_count)
        time.sleep(delay_ms / 1000)

        # Update attempt counter
        state.attempt_count += 1
        state.last_attempt_timestamp = datetime.now().isoformat()
        verifier.update_retry_state(state)

        # Retry verification (would be called again by hook)
        print(f"Retrying verification (attempt {state.attempt_count}/{state.max_attempts})")
    else:
        print(f"Max retries exceeded or circuit breaker open")
        # Handle permanent failure
```

### Security Considerations

**Path Traversal (CWE-22)**:
- All file operations validated via `security_utils.validate_path()`
- State files isolated to `.claude/loop_back/` directory
- Session IDs must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$` pattern

**Denial of Service**:
- Circuit breaker prevents infinite retry loops
- Max attempt limit prevents resource exhaustion
- Exponential backoff prevents server overload

**Data Integrity**:
- Atomic writes via tempfile + rename prevent corruption
- State files contain only non-sensitive metadata

### Test Coverage

Test Files:
- `tests/unit/lib/test_completion_verifier.py` (26 tests)
- `tests/unit/hooks/test_verify_completion_hook.py` (25 tests)

Coverage: 51 test cases covering:
- Verification logic (all 8 agents, missing agents)
- Circuit breaker (opening/closing, state persistence)
- Exponential backoff (all retry attempts, max delay capping)
- State persistence (load/save, file handling)
- Error handling (invalid session, file not found, JSON errors)
- Edge cases (empty session, duplicate agents, agent ordering)
- Integration with hook lifecycle

Target: 90+% coverage

## 59. hook_exit_codes.py (139 lines, v4.0.0+)

**Purpose**: Standardized exit code constants and lifecycle constraints for all hooks

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/hook_exit_codes.py`

### Overview

Defines symbolic constants for hook exit codes and lifecycle constraints that determine which exit codes are valid for different hook types. Prevents hardcoded exit codes scattered throughout hook implementations.

### Constants

#### Exit Code Constants

```python
EXIT_SUCCESS = 0  # Operation succeeded, continue workflow normally
EXIT_WARNING = 1  # Non-critical issue detected, continue workflow with warning
EXIT_BLOCK = 2    # Critical issue detected, block workflow (if lifecycle supports it)
```

### Lifecycle Constraints

Defines allowed exit codes for each hook lifecycle:

```python
LIFECYCLE_CONSTRAINTS = {
    "PreToolUse": {
        "allowed_exits": [EXIT_SUCCESS],
        "can_block": False,
        "description": "PreToolUse hooks run AFTER user approved tool execution..."
    },
    "SubagentStop": {
        "allowed_exits": [EXIT_SUCCESS],
        "can_block": False,
        "description": "SubagentStop hooks run AFTER agent completes..."
    },
    "PreSubagent": {
        "allowed_exits": [EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK],
        "can_block": True,
        "description": "PreSubagent hooks run BEFORE agent spawn..."
    },
}
```

### Functions

#### `can_lifecycle_block(lifecycle: str) -> bool`

**Purpose**: Check if a lifecycle can block workflow

**Parameters**:
- `lifecycle` (str): Hook lifecycle name (PreToolUse, SubagentStop, PreSubagent, etc.)

**Returns**: `bool` - True if lifecycle can exit with EXIT_BLOCK (2)

**Raises**: `KeyError` if lifecycle not defined

**Examples**:
```python
>>> can_lifecycle_block("PreToolUse")
False

>>> can_lifecycle_block("PreSubagent")
True
```

#### `is_exit_allowed(lifecycle: str, exit_code: int) -> bool`

**Purpose**: Check if an exit code is allowed for a given lifecycle

**Parameters**:
- `lifecycle` (str): Hook lifecycle name
- `exit_code` (int): Exit code to check (0, 1, or 2)

**Returns**: `bool` - True if exit code is allowed for lifecycle

**Raises**: `KeyError` if lifecycle not defined

**Examples**:
```python
>>> is_exit_allowed("PreToolUse", EXIT_BLOCK)
False

>>> is_exit_allowed("PreSubagent", EXIT_BLOCK)
True

>>> is_exit_allowed("SubagentStop", EXIT_SUCCESS)
True
```

#### `get_lifecycle_description(lifecycle: str) -> str`

**Purpose**: Get description of lifecycle constraints

**Parameters**:
- `lifecycle` (str): Hook lifecycle name

**Returns**: `str` - Description explaining lifecycle constraints and valid exit codes

**Raises**: `KeyError` if lifecycle not defined

**Examples**:
```python
>>> desc = get_lifecycle_description("PreToolUse")
>>> print(desc)
PreToolUse hooks run before tool execution. They MUST always exit 0...
```

### Lifecycle Breakdown

#### PreToolUse
- **When**: Runs before tool execution
- **Allowed exits**: EXIT_SUCCESS (0) only
- **Can block**: No
- **Why**: User already approved tool, cannot retroactively prevent execution
- **Use**: Logging, permission checks, security validation (all non-blocking)

#### SubagentStop
- **When**: Runs after agent completes
- **Allowed exits**: EXIT_SUCCESS (0) only
- **Can block**: No
- **Why**: Agent work already done, cannot block after completion
- **Use**: Post-processing (git commits), logging, completion verification

#### PreSubagent
- **When**: Runs before agent spawns
- **Allowed exits**: EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK
- **Can block**: Yes
- **Why**: Agent hasn't run yet, can prevent invalid work from starting
- **Use**: Quality gates, validation before expensive operations

#### PreCommit
- **When**: Runs before commit
- **Allowed exits**: EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK
- **Can block**: Yes
- **Why**: Commit hasn't happened yet, can enforce requirements
- **Use**: Code quality validation, test coverage checks, lint rules

#### PostCommit
- **When**: Runs after commit
- **Allowed exits**: EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK
- **Can block**: Yes (won't affect already-committed changes)
- **Use**: Notifications, statistics updates

#### UserPromptSubmit
- **When**: Runs when user submits prompt
- **Allowed exits**: EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK
- **Can block**: Yes
- **Why**: Submission not yet processed, can prevent invalid submissions
- **Use**: Input validation, alignment checks

### Usage Examples

**Basic Success Pattern**:
```python
from hook_exit_codes import EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK
import sys

if validation_passes:
    sys.exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)  # Exit 0 - Workflow continues
```

**Lifecycle-Aware Exit Code**:
```python
from hook_exit_codes import (
    EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_WARNING, EXIT_BLOCK,
    can_lifecycle_block, get_lifecycle_description
)
import os
import sys

lifecycle = os.environ.get("HOOK_LIFECYCLE", "PreCommit")

if critical_issue_detected:
    if can_lifecycle_block(lifecycle):
        sys.exit(EXIT_BLOCK)  # Exit 2 - Block workflow
    else:
        # This lifecycle cannot block - use warning instead
        print(f"WARNING: {get_lifecycle_description(lifecycle)}")
        sys.exit(EXIT_WARNING)  # Exit 1 - Continue with warning
else:
    sys.exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)
```

**Validation Check Pattern**:
```python
from hook_exit_codes import is_exit_allowed, LIFECYCLE_CONSTRAINTS
import sys

lifecycle = "PreToolUse"
proposed_exit = 2  # EXIT_BLOCK

if not is_exit_allowed(lifecycle, proposed_exit):
    print(f"ERROR: {lifecycle} cannot exit {proposed_exit}")
    print(f"Allowed exits: {LIFECYCLE_CONSTRAINTS[lifecycle]['allowed_exits']}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Design Benefits

1. **Semantic Clarity**: `EXIT_BLOCK` clearer than hardcoded `sys.exit(2)`
2. **Self-Documenting**: Constant names explain intent
3. **Prevents Inversion Bugs**: Harder to accidentally swap exit codes
4. **Centralized Definition**: Single source of truth (not scattered across hooks)
5. **Type Safety**: Import errors caught at startup, not runtime
6. **Lifecycle Validation**: Prevents invalid exit codes for hook type
7. **Discoverability**: Easy to view all constraints via LIFECYCLE_CONSTRAINTS dict

### Constraints

**Important Restrictions**:
- PreToolUse hooks: Must always exit 0 (cannot block)
- SubagentStop hooks: Must always exit 0 (cannot block)
- All other hooks: Can exit 0, 1, or 2

**Why**: PreToolUse and SubagentStop run at moments when blocking is impossible (tool already approved, agent already complete).

### Test Coverage

Test File: `tests/unit/lib/test_hook_exit_codes.py` (23 tests)

Coverage includes:
- **Constants**: Exit code values (0, 1, 2), distinctness, type validation, range validation
- **Lifecycle constraints**: All 3 lifecycles exist, constraints complete, required keys present
- **Allowed exits**: Each lifecycle has proper allowed exits list
- **Can block**: Correctly identifies which lifecycles support blocking
- **Documentation**: Module and constraint descriptions exist
- **Helper functions**: All 3 helper functions work correctly
- **Error cases**: Invalid lifecycles raise KeyError, invalid exits detected
- **Usage patterns**: Common patterns (success, warning, block, lifecycle checks) work

Target: 100% coverage of exit code semantics

### Used By

Hooks throughout autonomous-dev:
- All PreCommit hooks
- All PreSubagent hooks
- All PostCommit hooks
- All UserPromptSubmit hooks

Examples:
- `unified_code_quality.py` - PreCommit, can block on test failures
- `verify_completion.py` - SubagentStop, must exit 0
- `auto_tdd_enforcer.py` - PreSubagent, can block on missing tests

---

## 60. status_tracker.py (363 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #174)

**Purpose**: Manages test execution status for pre-commit gate hook (block-at-submit validation).

**Problem**: Need reliable test status tracking across different processes so pre-commit hook can check if tests passed before allowing commit.

**Solution**: Provides JSON-based status persistence with cross-process communication between test runners and pre-commit gate hook.

### API

#### `get_status_file_path() -> Path`

**Purpose**: Get path to test status JSON file

**Returns**: Path object pointing to test-status.json in temp directory

**Location**: /tmp/.autonomous-dev/test-status.json (Linux/macOS) or system temp (Windows)

**Security**:
- Returns absolute path (prevents relative path attacks)
- No user input in path construction
- Path is deterministic and not user-controllable

**Examples**:
```python
from status_tracker import get_status_file_path
path = get_status_file_path()
assert path.is_absolute()
assert ".autonomous-dev" in str(path)
```

#### `write_status(passed: bool, timestamp: Optional[str] = None) -> None`

**Purpose**: Write test execution status to JSON file

**Parameters**:
- `passed` (bool): True if tests passed, False if failed
- `timestamp` (str, optional): ISO 8601 timestamp (defaults to current time)

**Raises**:
- `ValueError`: If timestamp format is invalid
- `OSError`: If file cannot be written (permissions, disk full, etc.)

**Security**:
- Atomic writes: Write to temp file, then rename
- Secure permissions: 0600 (user-only read/write)
- Path validation: Prevents traversal and symlink attacks (CWE-22, CWE-59)
- Input validation: Validates timestamp format

**Status File Format**:
```json
{
  "passed": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "last_run": "2026-01-01T12:00:00.123456Z"
}
```

**Usage Examples**:
```python
from status_tracker import write_status

# After successful test run (auto-timestamp)
write_status(passed=True)

# After failed test run (auto-timestamp)
write_status(passed=False)

# With explicit timestamp
write_status(passed=True, timestamp="2026-01-01T12:00:00Z")
```

#### `read_status() -> Dict[str, Any]`

**Purpose**: Read test execution status from JSON file

**Returns**: Dictionary with keys:
- `passed` (bool): True if tests passed, False otherwise
- `timestamp` (str | None): ISO 8601 timestamp of test run
- `last_run` (str | None): ISO 8601 timestamp of status update

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Missing file: Returns safe default (passed=False)
- Corrupted JSON: Returns safe default (passed=False)
- Missing fields: Adds default values
- Invalid types: Returns safe default (passed=False)
- Permission errors: Returns safe default (passed=False)
- Symlinks detected: Returns safe default (passed=False)

**Security**:
- Validates path before reading (prevents traversal - CWE-22)
- Checks for symlinks (prevents attack - CWE-59)
- Handles permission errors gracefully
- Never exposes sensitive data from corrupted files

**Usage Examples**:
```python
from status_tracker import read_status

status = read_status()
if status["passed"]:
    print("Tests passed!")
else:
    print("Tests failed or not run")

# Check timestamp
if status["timestamp"]:
    print(f"Last run: {status['timestamp']}")
```

### Integration

**With pre_commit_gate hook**:
```python
# pre_commit_gate.py reads status to decide whether to block
from status_tracker import read_status

status = read_status()
if status["passed"]:
    sys.exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)  # Allow commit
else:
    sys.exit(EXIT_BLOCK)    # Block commit
```

**With test-master agent in /implement**:
```python
# test-master writes status after running tests
from status_tracker import write_status

# After all tests pass
write_status(passed=True)

# Or if tests fail
write_status(passed=False)
```

### Configuration

**Environment Variables**: None (file path is deterministic)

**Status File Permissions**: 0600 (user-only read/write)

**ISO 8601 Timestamps**: All timestamps use UTC timezone for cross-platform compatibility

### Error Handling

**Atomic Write Strategy**:
- Write to temporary file first
- Rename temp file to target atomically (prevents corruption)
- Clean up temp file on error
- Raises OSError with context if write fails

**Safe Defaults on Read Errors**:
- Any read error returns {"passed": False, ...} (fail-safe)
- Prevents false positives (incorrect "tests passed" claims)
- Never blocks on missing/corrupted status
- Clear error messages in logs for debugging

### Examples

**Basic workflow**:
```python
# 1. Test runner writes status after execution
from status_tracker import write_status
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(["pytest"], capture_output=True)
if result.returncode == 0:
    write_status(passed=True)
else:
    write_status(passed=False)

# 2. Pre-commit hook reads status
from status_tracker import read_status

status = read_status()
if status["passed"]:
    # Allow commit
    sys.exit(0)
else:
    # Block commit
    sys.exit(2)
```

**With /implement pipeline**:
```python
# test-master agent runs tests and writes status
write_status(passed=all_tests_pass)

# When user commits, pre_commit_gate checks status
# Status is already written by test-master
# Gate blocks or allows based on status
```

### Test Coverage

Test File: tests/unit/lib/status_tracker.py

Coverage includes:
- **Get path**: Path is absolute, contains expected directory
- **Write status**: File created, permissions set, JSON valid
- **Read status**: Returns correct structure, handles missing file
- **Atomic writes**: Temp file cleanup on error
- **Security**: Symlink detection, path validation, permission checks
- **Graceful degradation**: Corrupted JSON handled, missing fields defaulted
- **Timestamp validation**: Valid ISO 8601 accepted, invalid rejected
- **Cross-process**: Multiple writes/reads work correctly

Target: 95% coverage of core functionality

### Used By

- `pre_commit_gate.py` hook - Reads status to determine commit permission
- `test-master` agent in `/implement` - Writes status after test execution
- Manual pytest runs - Users can write status via CLI

## 61. worktree_manager.py (684 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #178)

**Purpose**: Safe git worktree isolation for parallel feature development

**Problem**: Developers need to work on multiple features in parallel without affecting the main branch. Standard branching requires switching contexts repeatedly.

**Solution**: Comprehensive git worktree management system with automatic isolation, collision detection, and safe merge operations.

### Features

- **Create worktrees**: Spawn isolated working directories for each feature
- **List worktrees**: Display all active worktrees with metadata (status, branch, commit, creation time)
- **Delete worktrees**: Remove worktrees with optional force flag for uncommitted changes
- **Merge worktrees**: Merge worktree branches back to target branch with conflict detection
- **Prune stale**: Automatically clean up orphaned/old worktrees (configurable age threshold)
- **Path queries**: Get worktree path by feature name
- **Security**: Path traversal prevention (CWE-22), command injection prevention (CWE-78), symlink resolution (CWE-59)
- **Graceful degradation**: Failures don't crash, return error tuples for safe handling
- **Atomic operations**: Collision detection with timestamp suffix for duplicate names
- **Parallel development**: Work on 5+ features simultaneously without branch switching

### Main Components

- **Purpose**: Create isolated worktree for feature development
- **Parameters**:
  - feature_name (str): Feature name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, dots only)
  - base_branch (str): Base branch to branch from (default: 'master')
- **Returns**: Tuple of (success, result) where result is Path on success or error_message on failure
- **Security**: Validates feature name (CWE-22, CWE-78), uses subprocess list args (no shell), resolves symlinks
- **Collision Handling**: If feature name exists, appends timestamp (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
- **Errors Handled**:
  - Empty/invalid feature name
  - Path traversal attempts
  - Branch already checked out
  - Invalid/missing base branch
  - No disk space
  - Timeout (30s)

#### list_worktrees() -> List[WorktreeInfo]

- **Purpose**: List all git worktrees with metadata
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: List of WorktreeInfo objects (empty list on error)
- **Status Detection**:
  - active: Worktree exists and on a branch
  - stale: Worktree directory doesn't exist
  - detached: Worktree in detached HEAD state
- **Performance**: Uses git porcelain format for efficient parsing

#### delete_worktree(feature_name, force=False) -> Tuple[bool, str]

- **Purpose**: Delete a worktree
- **Parameters**:
  - feature_name (str): Feature name of worktree to delete
  - force (bool): Force deletion even with uncommitted changes (default: False)
- **Returns**: Tuple of (success, message)
- **Validation**: Checks feature name format before deletion
- **Errors Handled**:
  - Worktree not found
  - Uncommitted changes (unless force=True)
  - Permission denied

#### merge_worktree(feature_name, target_branch='master') -> MergeResult

- **Purpose**: Merge worktree branch back to target branch
- **Parameters**:
  - feature_name (str): Feature name to merge
  - target_branch (str): Target branch for merge (default: 'master')
- **Returns**: MergeResult with success/conflicts/merged_files/error_message
- **Merge Flow**:
  1. Validate feature name
  2. Checkout target branch
  3. Merge feature branch
  4. Get list of merged files (if successful)
  5. Detect conflicts (if merge failed)
- **Conflict Detection**: Uses multiple strategies
  - git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U (unmerged)
  - git status --porcelain with status codes (UU, AA, DD, AU, UA, DU, UD)
- **Errors Handled**:
  - Invalid feature name
  - Target branch not found
  - Detached HEAD state
  - Merge conflicts
  - Timeout (30s)

#### prune_stale_worktrees(max_age_days=7) -> int

- **Purpose**: Remove stale/orphaned worktrees
- **Parameters**:
  - max_age_days (int): Maximum age threshold in days (default: 7)
- **Returns**: Number of worktrees pruned
- **Pruning Criteria**:
  - Worktree directory doesn't exist (orphaned)
  - Worktree older than max_age_days (uses directory mtime)
  - Only prunes managed worktrees (containing 'worktrees' in path)
  - Skips main repository

#### get_worktree_path(feature_name) -> Optional[Path]

- **Purpose**: Get path to a worktree by feature name
- **Parameters**: feature_name (str): Feature name
- **Returns**: Path to worktree or None if not found

### Internal Functions

#### _validate_feature_name(name) -> Tuple[bool, str]

- **Purpose**: Security validation for feature names
- **Checks**:
  - Non-empty string
  - No path traversal (.., /)
  - No shell injection (;, &, |, parentheses)
  - Only alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, dots
- **Returns**: Tuple of (is_valid, error_message)

#### _get_worktree_base_dir() -> Path

- **Purpose**: Get base directory for worktrees (.worktrees/ in cwd)
- **Returns**: Path to .worktrees directory
- **Note**: Uses current working directory, no git calls needed

### Configuration

**Environment Variables**: None (configuration is function parameters)

**Default Worktree Location**: .worktrees/<feature-name>/ in current directory

**Naming Conventions**:
- Feature names: alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, dots only
- Directory structure: <repo>/.worktrees/<feature-name>/
- Collision handling: <feature-name>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS if name exists

### Security Analysis

**Threat Model**:
1. **Path Traversal (CWE-22)**: Blocked by feature name validation (no .., /)
2. **Command Injection (CWE-78)**: Blocked by subprocess list args (no shell=True), feature name validation
3. **Symlink Attacks (CWE-59)**: Blocked by Path.resolve() during worktree path generation

**Validation Layers**:
1. Feature name validation (regex check)
2. subprocess list args (no shell interpolation)
3. Path resolution (symlink detection via resolve())
4. Error messages (no stderr leakage)

### Error Handling Strategy

**All functions return safe tuples/objects**:
- create_worktree(): (bool, Union[Path, str]) - easy error checking
- delete_worktree(): (bool, str) - message for logging
- merge_worktree(): MergeResult dataclass - structured conflict info
- list_worktrees(): List[WorktreeInfo] - empty list on error
- prune_stale_worktrees(): int - 0 on error
- get_worktree_path(): Optional[Path] - None if not found

**Exceptions**: Only raises on programming errors, not operational failures

### Performance

- **Create worktree**: ~1-2 seconds (git worktree add + symlink resolution)
- **List worktrees**: ~50-100ms (porcelain parsing)
- **Merge worktree**: ~0.5-5 seconds (depends on file count)
- **Prune stale**: ~100-500ms (depends on number of worktrees)
- **Get path**: ~5-10ms (list + lookup)

### Test Coverage

- Feature name validation (empty, path traversal, injection, invalid chars)
- Worktree creation (success, collision handling, branch errors)
- Worktree listing (parsing, status detection, metadata)
- Worktree deletion (success, force flag, not found)
- Merge operations (success, conflicts, checkout errors)
- Prune operations (stale detection, orphaned cleanup)
- Path queries (found, not found, empty list)

## 62. memory_layer.py (766 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #179)

**Purpose**: Cross-session memory layer for context continuity - persistent memory storage across /implement sessions enabling agents to remember architectural decisions, blockers, patterns, and context without re-research.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/memory_layer.py`

### Problem Statement

Issue #179 identified that context resets between /implement sessions force expensive re-research:
- No persistent memory between sessions
- Architectural decisions must be rediscovered
- Blocker knowledge is lost
- Pattern findings don't carry over

### Solution

A JSON-based memory layer stored in `.claude/memory.json` with:
- **Memory types**: feature, decision, blocker, pattern, context
- **Utility scoring**: Recency decay + access frequency ranking
- **PII sanitization**: API keys, passwords, emails, JWT tokens redacted
- **Atomic writes**: Temp file + rename pattern prevents corruption
- **Thread-safe operations**: File locking for concurrent access
- **Graceful degradation**: Storage errors don't crash workflow

### Key Functions

```python
from memory_layer import MemoryLayer, sanitize_pii, calculate_utility_score

# Initialize layer
layer = MemoryLayer()  # Uses .claude/memory.json
layer = MemoryLayer(memory_file=Path("/custom/path.json"))

# Store a memory
memory_id = layer.remember(
    memory_type="decision",
    content={"title": "Database Choice", "summary": "Chose PostgreSQL for ACID compliance"},
    metadata={"tags": ["database", "architecture"]}
)

# Retrieve memories
all_memories = layer.recall()  # All memories, sorted by utility score
decisions = layer.recall(memory_type="decision")  # Filter by type
tagged = layer.recall(filters={"tags": ["database"]})  # Filter by tags
recent = layer.recall(filters={"after": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"})  # Date filter

# Forget memories
count = layer.forget(memory_id="mem_123")  # By ID
count = layer.forget(filters={"tags": ["deprecated"]})  # By filter

# Prune old/low-utility memories
removed = layer.prune(max_entries=1000, max_age_days=90)

# Get statistics
summary = layer.get_summary()  # Returns dict with counts, scores, etc.

# PII sanitization (automatic in remember, available standalone)
safe_text = sanitize_pii("API key: sk-1234abcd for user@example.com")
# Returns: "API key: [REDACTED_API_KEY] for [REDACTED_EMAIL]"

# Utility scoring
score = calculate_utility_score(created_at=datetime.now(), access_count=5)
```

### Memory Structure

```json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "memories": [
        {
            "id": "mem_20260102_153042_abc123",
            "type": "decision",

                "utility_score": 0.85
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Security Features

- **CWE-22 Prevention**: Path traversal validation via validate_path()
- **CWE-59 Prevention**: Symlink detection and rejection
- **CWE-359 Prevention**: PII sanitization (API keys, passwords, emails, JWTs)
- **Atomic writes**: Prevents corruption from interrupted writes
- **File locking**: Thread-safe concurrent access
- **Audit logging**: All operations logged (with safe wrapper for test env)

### Utility Scoring Algorithm

```python
utility_score = recency_score * (1 - weight) + frequency_score * weight

# Recency: Exponential decay with 30-day half-life
recency_score = 2 ** (-age_days / 30)

# Frequency: Normalized by max access count (20)
frequency_score = min(1.0, access_count / 20)

# Weight: 0.3 (30% frequency, 70% recency)
```

## 63. complexity_assessor.py (441 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #181)

**Purpose**: Automatic complexity assessment for pipeline scaling

**Key Concepts**:
- Keyword-based heuristics for fast complexity classification
- Confidence scoring to indicate assessment certainty
- Agent count and time recommendations based on complexity
- Security-first approach: COMPLEX keywords override SIMPLE keywords

### Classes

#### `ComplexityLevel` (Enum)

**Values**:
- `SIMPLE` - Simple changes (typos, docs, formatting) - 3 agents, ~8 min
- `STANDARD` - Standard features (bug fixes, small features) - 6 agents, ~15 min
- `COMPLEX` - Complex features (auth, security, APIs) - 8 agents, ~25 min

#### `ComplexityAssessment` (NamedTuple)

**Attributes**:
- `level` (ComplexityLevel): Assessed complexity level (SIMPLE/STANDARD/COMPLEX)
- `confidence` (float): Confidence score for assessment (0.0-1.0)
- `reasoning` (str): Human-readable explanation of classification
- `agent_count` (int): Recommended number of agents (3/6/8)
- `estimated_time` (int): Estimated time in minutes (8/15/25)

#### `ComplexityAssessor` (Class)

**Design**:
- Stateless: No instance variables, all methods can be class methods
- Keyword-based: Fast heuristics for common patterns
- Conservative: Defaults to STANDARD when uncertain
- Security-first: COMPLEX keywords override SIMPLE keywords

**Keyword Sets**:
- SIMPLE_KEYWORDS: typo, spelling, docs, documentation, readme, rename, format, formatting, comment, whitespace, indentation, style, lint, pep8, black
- COMPLEX_KEYWORDS: auth, authentication, authorization, security, encrypt, encryption, jwt, oauth, oauth2, saml, ldap, password, credential, token, api, webhook, database, migration, schema

### Methods

#### `assess(feature_description, github_issue=None)` - Main entry point

**Signature**: `@classmethod assess(feature_description: str, github_issue: Optional[Dict] = None) -> ComplexityAssessment`

**Purpose**: Assess complexity of a feature request

**Parameters**:
- `feature_description` (str): Feature request text to analyze
- `github_issue` (Optional[Dict]): GitHub issue dict with 'title' and 'body' keys (optional)

**Returns**: ComplexityAssessment with level, confidence, reasoning, agent_count, time

**Edge Cases**:
- Handles None input (defaults to STANDARD with 0.4 confidence)
- Handles empty/whitespace input (defaults to STANDARD with 0.4 confidence)
- Truncates input >10000 chars with warning
- Combines feature description with GitHub issue (body weighted higher)

**Example**:
```python
assessor = ComplexityAssessor()
result = assessor.assess("Fix typo in README")
print(f"Level: {result.level}, Agents: {result.agent_count}")
# Output: Level: ComplexityLevel.SIMPLE, Agents: 3
```

#### `_analyze_keywords(text)` - Keyword-based classification

**Signature**: `@classmethod _analyze_keywords(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`

**Purpose**: Analyze text for SIMPLE and COMPLEX keyword indicators

**Parameters**: `text` (str): Text to analyze

**Returns**: Dict with 'simple_count', 'complex_count', 'simple_keywords', 'complex_keywords'

**Purpose**: Analyze text for scope indicators (file counts, conjunctions)

**Parameters**: `text` (str): Text to analyze

**Returns**: Dict with 'conjunction_count', 'file_type_count', 'word_count', 'alphabetic_count'

**Algorithm**:
- Count conjunctions: and, or, also, plus, additionally (regex-based)
- Count unique file types: .py, .js, .md, etc. (regex-based)
- Calculate word count and alphabetic word count
- Used as secondary indicator for scope breadth

#### `_determine_level(indicators)` - Complexity level determination

**Signature**: `@classmethod _determine_level(indicators: Dict) -> ComplexityLevel`

**Purpose**: Determine complexity level from indicators

**Priority**:
1. COMPLEX keywords override SIMPLE keywords (security-first approach)
2. SIMPLE keywords with no conflicts
3. STANDARD as default fallback

**Algorithm**:
- If complex_count > 0: return COMPLEX
- Else if simple_count > 0: return SIMPLE
- Else: return STANDARD

#### `_calculate_confidence(indicators)` - Confidence scoring

**Signature**: `@classmethod _calculate_confidence(indicators: Dict) -> float`

**Purpose**: Calculate confidence score (0.0-1.0) for assessment

**Confidence Factors**:
- Single keyword match: 0.85 base
- Multiple keyword matches: +0.05 per additional (max +0.10)
- Conflicting signals: -0.30 penalty
- No keywords but detailed: 0.6 (reasonable default to STANDARD)
- No keywords and vague/garbage: 0.4-0.5 (very ambiguous)

**Algorithm**:
```
If no keywords detected:
  If alphabetic_count == 0: confidence = 0.4 (garbage input)
  Elif word_count < 5: confidence = 0.5 (very ambiguous)
  Else: confidence = 0.6 (detailed request)
Else:
  confidence = 0.85 (base for any keyword match)
  If total_keywords >= 2: confidence += 0.05
  If total_keywords >= 3: confidence += 0.05
  If simple_count > 0 AND complex_count > 0: confidence -= 0.30
  Clamp confidence to [0.0, 1.0]
```

#### `_generate_reasoning(level, indicators, confidence)` - Reasoning generation

## 64. pause_controller.py (403 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #182)

**Purpose**: File-based pause controls and human input handling for autonomous workflows

**Problem**: Long-running autonomous workflows need to pause at checkpoints to accept human feedback, approvals, or instructions without losing state.

**Solution**: Comprehensive pause/resume system with file-based signaling, checkpoint persistence, and secure file operations.

### Key Files

- `.claude/PAUSE` - Touch file to signal pause request
- `.claude/HUMAN_INPUT.md` - Optional file with human instructions/feedback
- `.claude/pause_checkpoint.json` - Checkpoint state for resume

### Functions

#### `check_pause_requested()` -> bool

**Purpose**: Check if pause is requested via .claude/PAUSE file

**Returns**: True if PAUSE file exists and is valid, False otherwise

**Security**:
- Rejects symlinks (CWE-59)
- Returns False if .claude dir doesn't exist
- Path traversal prevention

#### `read_human_input()` -> Optional[str]

**Purpose**: Read content from .claude/HUMAN_INPUT.md file

**Returns**: File content as string, or None if file doesn't exist

**Security**:
- Rejects symlinks (CWE-59)
- 1MB file size limit (DoS prevention)
- Handles unicode properly
- Returns None on permission errors
- Path traversal prevention

**Features**:
- Graceful handling of missing files
- Automatic encoding detection
- Safe error recovery

#### `clear_pause_state()` -> None

**Purpose**: Remove PAUSE and HUMAN_INPUT.md files to resume workflow

**Behavior**:
- Idempotent (no error if files don't exist)
- Preserves checkpoint file (separate lifecycle)
- Removes both signal files

**Security**:
- Validates paths before deletion
- Only removes PAUSE and HUMAN_INPUT.md
- Never follows symlinks

#### `save_checkpoint(agent_name, state)` -> None

**Purpose**: Save checkpoint state to .claude/pause_checkpoint.json for resume

**Parameters**:
- `agent_name` (str): Name of agent saving checkpoint
- `state` (Dict[str, Any]): State dictionary to save

**Security**:
- Atomic write (write to temp file, then rename)
- Input validation for agent_name
- Path validation before write
- Atomic rename prevents partial writes

**Checkpoint Structure**:
```json
{
  "agent": "agent_name",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-02T12:34:56.123456+00:00",
  "step": 3,
  "data": "..."
}
```

#### `load_checkpoint()` -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]

**Purpose**: Load checkpoint from .claude/pause_checkpoint.json

**Returns**: Checkpoint data as dictionary, or None if:
- File doesn't exist
- JSON is invalid
- File is empty
- Permission denied

**Security**:
- Validates path before reading
- Handles corrupted JSON gracefully
- Rejects invalid file formats
- Returns None for errors (graceful degradation)

#### `validate_pause_path(path)` -> bool

**Purpose**: Validate path for pause-related file operations

**Parameters**: `path` (str): Path to validate

**Returns**: True if path is valid and safe, False otherwise

**Security Validations**:
- CWE-22: Reject path traversal attempts (..)
- CWE-59: Reject symlinks
- Ensure path is within .claude/ directory
- Block null bytes (CWE-158)

### Workflow Integration

**Typical Workflow**:
1. User creates `.claude/PAUSE` file to pause at next checkpoint
2. Optionally: User writes `.claude/HUMAN_INPUT.md` with instructions
3. Workflow checks `check_pause_requested()` at checkpoints
4. If paused: saves state with `save_checkpoint()`
5. Workflow reads instructions with `read_human_input()`
6. User provides feedback/approval
7. User removes `.claude/PAUSE` to signal resume
8. Workflow loads state with `load_checkpoint()` and continues

### Security Features

- **Path Traversal Prevention (CWE-22)**: Strict validation that all paths are within `.claude/` directory
- **Symlink Attack Prevention (CWE-59)**: All file checks detect and reject symlinks
- **Null Byte Injection (CWE-158)**: Blocks null bytes in paths
- **DoS Prevention**: 1MB file size limit on human input
- **Atomic Operations**: Checkpoint writes use temp file + rename for atomicity
- **Graceful Degradation**: All errors return safe defaults (None/False) instead of exceptions

### Test Coverage

- 44 unit tests for all functions
- 24 integration tests for workflow scenarios
- Security tests for path traversal, symlinks, null bytes
- Edge case tests for missing files, permissions, corrupted JSON

## 65. worktree_command.py (506 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #180)

**Purpose**: Interactive CLI interface for git worktree management

**Problem**: After features are developed in isolated worktrees, users need a way to review changes, merge to target branch, or discard work safely - all from the command line

**Solution**: Complete CLI with 5 modes (list, status, review, merge, discard) providing full worktree lifecycle management

### Key Features

- **Multi-mode interface**: List, status, review, merge, discard modes
- **Safe operations**: Destructive operations require explicit user approval
- **Formatted output**: Status indicators (clean, dirty, active, stale, detached)
- **Interactive review**: Shows diff and prompts for merge approval
- **Exit codes**: Standard codes (0=success, 1=warning, 2=user reject)

### Modes

#### List Mode (`--list` - DEFAULT)

Shows all active worktrees with status indicators.

**Usage**:
```bash
/worktree                # Default list mode
/worktree --list         # Explicit list mode
```

**Output**:
```
Feature              Branch                         Status
------------------------------------------------------------
feature-auth         feature/feature-auth           clean
feature-logging      feature/feature-logging        dirty
```

**Status Indicators**:
- `clean` - No uncommitted changes
- `dirty` - Has uncommitted changes
- `active` - Currently checked out
- `stale` - Directory missing (orphaned)
- `detached` - Detached HEAD state

#### Status Mode (`--status FEATURE`)

Detailed information for a specific worktree.

**Usage**:
```bash
/worktree --status feature-auth
```

**Output**:
```
Worktree Status: feature-auth
Path:            /project/.worktrees/feature-auth
Branch:          feature/feature-auth
Status:          dirty
Target Branch:   master
Commits Ahead:   5
Commits Behind:  2

Uncommitted Changes (3 files):
  - auth/models.py
  - auth/tests.py
  - README.md
```

**Fields**:
- Path: Full path to worktree directory
- Branch: Current branch name
- Status: clean/dirty/active/stale/detached
- Target Branch: Where commits will be merged
- Commits Ahead/Behind: Against target branch
- Uncommitted Changes: List of modified files

#### Review Mode (`--review FEATURE`)

Interactive diff review with approve/reject workflow.

**Usage**:
```bash
/worktree --review feature-auth
```

**Workflow**:
1. Shows full git diff against target branch
2. Prompts: "Approve or reject changes? [approve/reject]:"
3. If approve: Automatically merges to target branch
4. If reject: Exits without merging

**Output**:
```
Diff for worktree: feature-auth
============================================================
diff --git a/auth/models.py b/auth/models.py
[... full diff output ...]
============================================================

Approve or reject changes? [approve/reject]: approve

Successfully merged 12 files
```

#### Merge Mode (`--merge FEATURE`)

Directly merge worktree to target branch without review.

**Usage**:
```bash
/worktree --merge feature-auth
```

**Behavior**:
- Merges worktree branch to target branch
- Handles merge conflicts (reports and exits with code 1)
- Non-interactive (no approval prompt)

#### Discard Mode (`--discard FEATURE`)

Delete worktree with confirmation.

**Usage**:
```bash
/worktree --discard feature-auth
```

**Behavior**:
- Prompts for confirmation: "Delete worktree feature-auth? [y/N]:"
- If yes: Deletes worktree directory and git worktree entry
- If no: Exits without deleting
- Prevents accidental deletion of uncommitted work

### Implementation Details

**Design Pattern**: Wrapper CLI around worktree_manager.py library

**Architecture**:
- Parse arguments using argparse
- Delegate operations to worktree_manager.py functions
- Handle user interactions (prompts, confirmation)
- Format and display results
- Return appropriate exit codes

**User Prompts**:
- Review mode: Shows diff, prompts approve/reject
- Discard mode: Prompts for confirmation
- Review/merge prompts use Task tool for interactive input

**Error Handling**:
- Clear error messages for failed operations
- Non-blocking graceful degradation (non-git directories)
- Exit codes signal success/warning/user rejection

**Integration**:
- Designed to work with /implement worktree output
- Part of feature review and merge workflow
- Can be used standalone for worktree management

### API Functions

#### `main(args: List[str]) -> int`

**Purpose**: Main entry point for CLI

**Parameters**:
- `args` (List[str]): Command-line arguments (excluding program name)

**Modes Dispatched**:
- Empty or `--list` -> list_mode()
- `--status NAME` -> status_mode(NAME)
- `--review NAME` -> review_mode(NAME)
- `--merge NAME` -> merge_mode(NAME)
- `--discard NAME` -> discard_mode(NAME)

#### `list_mode() -> int`

Lists all active worktrees with formatted output.

**Returns**: 0 (always succeeds, even if no worktrees)

#### `status_mode(feature: str) -> int`

Shows detailed status for a worktree.

**Parameters**: `feature` (str): Worktree/feature name

**Returns**: 0=success, 1=worktree not found

#### `review_mode(feature: str) -> int`

Interactive diff review and merge.

**Parameters**: `feature` (str): Worktree/feature name

**Returns**: 0=success, 1=merge failed

#### `discard_mode(feature: str) -> int`

Delete worktree with confirmation.

**Parameters**: `feature` (str): Worktree/feature name

### Data Structures

#### `ParsedArgs` (dataclass)

Parsed command-line arguments.

**Fields**:
- `mode` (str): Operation mode (list, status, review, merge, discard)
- `feature` (Optional[str]): Feature name (None for list mode)

### Security

**Path Validation**:
- Validates worktree paths (CWE-22 path traversal prevention)
- Prevents directory traversal via feature names
- Rejects symlinks and suspicious paths

**Command Injection Prevention** (CWE-78):
- Feature names sanitized before shell commands
- Uses subprocess with list arguments (not shell=True)
- No user input passed directly to shell

**No File Writes**:
- Only reads git state and worktree metadata
- All modifications delegated to worktree_manager.py
- No file creation in user directories

### Test Coverage

**40 unit tests** covering:
- All 5 modes (list, status, review, merge, discard)
- Argument parsing (valid/invalid args)
- Output formatting
- User prompt handling
- Error conditions (missing worktrees, permission errors)
- Edge cases (empty list, special characters in names)

**Files**:
- tests/unit/test_worktree_command.py (40 tests)

### Performance

- List: 50-100ms (git worktree list)
- Status: 100-500ms (git log, git status for one worktree)
- Review: 0.5-5s (git diff, merge operations)
- Merge: 0.5-5s (git merge operation)
- Discard: 1-2s (worktree cleanup)

## 66. sandbox_enforcer.py (625 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #171)

**Purpose**: Command classification and OS-specific sandboxing to reduce permission prompts by 84%

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/sandbox_enforcer.py`

**Version**: 1.0.0 (2026-01-02, Issue #171 - Sandboxing for reduced permission prompts)

### Overview

SandboxEnforcer provides command classification (SAFE/BLOCKED/NEEDS_APPROVAL) and OS-specific sandboxing to eliminate repetitive permission prompts for safe operations.

**Problem It Solves**:
- Users approve 50+ permission prompts per /implement workflow
- 80%+ are for safe read-only commands (cat, ls, grep, git status)
- Each prompt breaks focus and adds 10-20 seconds overhead
- SandboxEnforcer reduces prompts from 50+ to roughly 8-10 (84% reduction)

**Solution**:
- Whitelist-first approach: Safe commands auto-approve without prompts
- Blocked patterns: Dangerous commands denied with audit logging
- OS-specific sandboxing: bwrap (Linux), sandbox-exec (macOS), none (Windows)
- Circuit breaker: Disables after threshold blocks (safety mechanism)

### Architecture

**4-Layer Integration**:
1. **Layer 0 (Sandbox)**: SAFE to auto-approve, BLOCKED to deny, NEEDS_APPROVAL to continue
2. **Layer 1 (MCP Security)**: Path traversal, injection, SSRF validation
3. **Layer 2 (Agent Auth)**: Pipeline agent detection
4. **Layer 3 (Batch Permission)**: Permission batching

**Integrated into**: `unified_pre_tool.py` hook (PreToolUse lifecycle)

**Environment Variables**:
- `SANDBOX_ENABLED` (bool, default: false) - Enable/disable sandbox layer
- `SANDBOX_PROFILE` (str, default: development) - Security profile (development/testing/production)

### Classes

#### `CommandClassification` (Enum)

Command classification results:

```
class CommandClassification(Enum):
    SAFE = "safe"
    BLOCKED = "blocked"
    NEEDS_APPROVAL = "needs_approval"
```

#### `SandboxBinary` (Enum)

OS-specific sandbox binaries:

```
class SandboxBinary(Enum):
    BWRAP = "bwrap"
    SANDBOX_EXEC = "sandbox-exec"
    NONE = "none"
```

#### `CommandResult` (Dataclass)

Result of command classification:

```
@dataclass
class CommandResult:
    classification: CommandClassification
    reason: Optional[str] = None
    can_sandbox: bool = False
```

#### `SandboxEnforcer` (Main Class)

Command classifier and sandbox manager.

**Constructor**:
```
SandboxEnforcer(policy_path: Optional[str|Path] = None, profile: str = "development")
```

**Parameters**:
- `policy_path` (optional): Custom policy file (defaults to plugin policy.json)
- `profile` (str): Security profile - "development" (permissive), "testing" (moderate), "production" (strict)

**Key Methods**:

##### `is_command_safe(command: str) -> CommandResult`
Classify a command and determine permission decision.

**Parameters**: `command` (str) - Full command string

**Returns**: `CommandResult` with classification and reason

**Logic**:
1. Check circuit breaker (return BLOCKED if tripped)
2. Check if command is in safe_commands list (return SAFE)
3. Check for blocked patterns (return BLOCKED)
4. Check for shell injection patterns (return BLOCKED)
5. Check for path traversal (return BLOCKED)
6. Check for blocked file paths (return BLOCKED)
7. Return NEEDS_APPROVAL (continue to Layer 1)

**Example**:
```
enforcer = SandboxEnforcer()

result = enforcer.is_command_safe("cat README.md")
assert result.classification == CommandClassification.SAFE

result = enforcer.is_command_safe("rm command")
assert result.classification == CommandClassification.BLOCKED
```

##### `get_sandbox_binary() -> SandboxBinary`
Detect OS-specific sandbox binary availability.

**Returns**: SandboxBinary enum (BWRAP, SANDBOX_EXEC, or NONE)

**Behavior**:
- Linux: Check for `bwrap` (bubblewrap)
- macOS: Check for `sandbox-exec`
- Windows: Return NONE
- Fallback: Return NONE if binary not found

##### `build_sandbox_args(command: str) -> List[str]`
Build OS-specific sandbox arguments for command wrapping.

**Parameters**: `command` (str) - Original command

**Returns**: List[str] - Sandbox wrapper plus original command

**OS-Specific Behavior**:

Linux (bwrap): Wraps with tmpfs isolation and bind mounts

macOS (sandbox-exec): Wraps with operation deny policy

Windows (none): Returns original command as-is (no sandboxing)

### Validation Methods

#### `validate_policy(policy: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool`
Validate policy JSON schema.

**Checks**:
- Version field present
- Profiles dict present
- Each profile has required sections
- Security settings valid

**Raises**: `PolicyValidationError` if validation fails

### Security Features

**Shell Injection Detection** (CWE-78):
- Detects dangerous shell metacharacters
- Blocks commands with unsafe patterns
- Prevents command chaining and execution tricks

**Path Traversal Protection** (CWE-22):
- Detects pattern matching in commands
- Blocks access to sensitive files: .env, .ssh, credential files
- Validates all file paths in commands

**Circuit Breaker** (DoS Prevention):
- Trips after threshold blocks (configurable per profile)
- Automatically disables sandbox after repeated violations
- Prevents brute-force attempts to bypass sandbox

**Audit Logging**:
- Logs all decisions to security audit log
- Records command, classification, reason
- Thread-safe logging with file rotation

### Policy Profiles

**Profile: Development** (Most Permissive)

Safe commands: cat, echo, grep, ls, pwd, which, git status, git diff, pytest

Blocked patterns: rm command, sudo, git push variants, eval, wget patterns, curl patterns

Blocked paths: .env, .ssh/, credentials.json, key files, /etc/shadow

Circuit breaker: 10 blocks before tripping

**Profile: Testing** (Moderate)

Stricter than development with fewer safe commands and 5-block circuit breaker

**Profile: Production** (Strictest)

Minimal auto-approvals with 3-block circuit breaker

### Configuration

**Policy File Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/config/sandbox_policy.json`

**Custom Policy** (Project-Local Override):
Create `.claude/config/sandbox_policy.json` with custom profiles

### Integration with unified_pre_tool.py

**Layer 0 Decision Logic**:

Tool call received -> Extract command -> Classify with SandboxEnforcer -> Return decision

### Examples

**Example 1: Safe Read-Only Command**
```
result = enforcer.is_command_safe("grep pattern src/")
Classification: SAFE (grep is in safe_commands list)
Action: Auto-approve, skip permission prompt
```

**Example 2: Blocked Dangerous Pattern**
```
result = enforcer.is_command_safe("rm command /home/user")
Classification: BLOCKED (matches blocked pattern)
Action: Deny with audit log
```

**Example 3: Unknown Command**
```
result = enforcer.is_command_safe("custom-linter options")
Classification: NEEDS_APPROVAL (not in safe list, no blocked patterns)
Action: Continue to Layer 1 (MCP Security validation)
```

**Example 4: Sandboxing on Linux**
```
binary = enforcer.get_sandbox_binary()
if binary == SandboxBinary.BWRAP:
    sandbox_args = enforcer.build_sandbox_args("cat file.txt")
    # Execute with subprocess
```

### Test Coverage

**50+ unit tests** covering:
- Command classification (SAFE/BLOCKED/NEEDS_APPROVAL)
- Safe command patterns
- Blocked patterns
- Injection detection
- Path traversal detection
- Blocked file patterns
- Sandbox binary detection
- Policy loading and validation
- Circuit breaker logic
- Cross-platform behavior
- Edge cases

**Files**:
- tests/unit/lib/test_sandbox_enforcer.py (50+ tests)

### Performance

- Command classification: less than 1ms (pattern matching)
- Sandbox binary detection: 5-50ms (first run, cached after)
- Policy loading: 10-20ms (per process startup)
- Circuit breaker check: less than 1ms (in-memory state)

**Optimization Notes**:
- Compiled regex patterns for performance
- Cached binary detection
- No filesystem I/O during classification

### Security Considerations

**What It Protects**:
- Command injection via shell metacharacters
- Path traversal attacks
- Sensitive data exposure via blocked file patterns
- DoS via brute-force bypass attempts

**What It Doesn't Protect**:
- Vulnerabilities in whitelisted commands
- Logic bugs in policy rules
- Malicious code execution
- Privilege escalation beyond blocked patterns

## 67. status_tracker.py (335 lines, v3.48.0+ - Issue #174)

**Purpose**: Test status tracking for pre-commit gate hook enforcement

**Module**: plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/status_tracker.py

**Problem**: Pre-commit hooks need to know if tests passed before allowing commits. A simple, reliable mechanism is needed for test runners to communicate test status to the commit hook.

**Solution**: Atomic file-based test status tracking with secure permissions and graceful degradation.

**Key Features**:
- **Atomic writes**: Write to temp file, then rename (prevents corruption if process crashes)
- **Secure storage**: /tmp/.autonomous-dev/test-status.json with 0600 file permissions and 0700 directory permissions
- **Graceful degradation**: All I/O errors return safe defaults (assume tests failed)
- **Safe defaults**: read_status() returns {"passed": False} if file missing/corrupted
- **Temporary storage**: Ephemeral in /tmp (cleared on system reboot)
- **Comprehensive validation**: JSON structure validation, type checking, timestamp validation

**API Reference**:

```python
from status_tracker import write_status, read_status, clear_status, get_status_file_path

# After test run completes
write_status(passed=True, details={"total": 100, "failed": 0})
# Returns: bool (True if write succeeded, False if failed)

# In pre-commit hook
status = read_status()
# Returns: Dict with at least {"passed": bool, "timestamp": str or None}
# Safe default on any error: {"passed": False, "timestamp": None}

if status.get("passed"):
    # Allow commit
    pass
else:
    # Block commit
    pass

# Clear status (optional)
clear_status()  # Returns: bool

# Get status file path
path = get_status_file_path()
# Returns: Path object (PosixPath on Unix, WindowsPath on Windows)
```

**Security Features**:
- **CWE-22 Prevention**: Hardcoded /tmp path (no user input, no traversal risk)
- **Atomic operations**: Rename is atomic at filesystem level (prevents race conditions)
- **Restricted permissions**: 0600 on files, 0700 on directory (owner read/write only)
- **Safe defaults**: Any I/O error returns safe "tests failed" default
- **JSON validation**: Validates parsed JSON structure before returning

**Main Functions**:

1. **write_status(passed, details=None) -> bool**
   - Write test status to /tmp/.autonomous-dev/test-status.json
   - Args: passed (bool), details (optional dict with additional data)
   - Returns: True if write succeeded, False if failed
   - Creates directory with 0700 permissions if missing
   - Sets file permissions to 0600 after write
   - Graceful degradation: Returns False on any error (doesn't raise)

2. **read_status() -> Dict[str, Any]**
   - Read test status from file
   - Returns: Dictionary with at least {"passed": bool, "timestamp": str or None}
   - Safe default: {"passed": False, "timestamp": None} on any error
   - Validates JSON structure and field types before returning
   - Graceful degradation: Returns safe default on missing file, parse errors, etc.

3. **clear_status() -> bool**
   - Delete the status file
   - Returns: True if deleted or didn't exist, False if deletion failed
   - Graceful degradation: Returns False on permission errors

4. **get_status_file_path() -> Path**
   - Get path to status file
   - Returns: pathlib.Path object
   - No I/O operations (just returns constant path)

5. **_ensure_status_dir() -> bool** (internal)
   - Ensure /tmp/.autonomous-dev/ exists with 0700 permissions
   - Returns: True if directory exists/was created, False if failed
   - Validates and fixes permissions if directory already existed

**Design Patterns**:
- **Graceful degradation**: All functions return safe defaults on errors, never raise
- **Atomic writes**: Uses temp file + rename pattern for data integrity
- **Safe defaults**: Assume tests failed if anything goes wrong
- **No user input**: Hardcoded paths prevent all traversal attacks

**Error Handling**:
- OSError, PermissionError: Caught and return False (graceful degradation)
- IOError, json.JSONDecodeError: Caught and return safe defaults
- Missing file: Treated as {"passed": False} (safe default)
- Corrupted JSON: Treated as {"passed": False} (safe default)
- Invalid field types: Cleaned up and returned with safe values

**Performance**:
- write_status(): ~2-5ms (file I/O)
- read_status(): ~1-3ms (file I/O + JSON parsing)
- clear_status(): ~1-2ms (file deletion)
- get_status_file_path(): <0.1ms (no I/O)

**Usage Examples**:

```python
# Test runner integration
import subprocess
from status_tracker import write_status

result = subprocess.run(['pytest', 'tests/'], capture_output=True)
write_status(
    passed=(result.returncode == 0),
    details={
        "total": 100,
        "failed": 0 if result.returncode == 0 else 5,
        "duration": 12.3
    }
)

# Pre-commit hook integration
from status_tracker import read_status

status = read_status()
if not status.get("passed"):
    print("Tests failed - commit blocked")
    print(f"Details: {status}")
    exit(1)  # Block commit
```

**Integration**:
- Used by: pre_commit_gate.py hook (blocks commits if tests failed)
- Called by: Test runners after test execution (write status)
- Non-blocking: Library itself has no side effects, hook decides action

**Security Audit**:
- Path validation: Hardcoded path only, no user input
- File permissions: 0600 (owner RW), 0700 (directory owner RWX)
- No symlink following: Verified no symlink traversal
- No subprocess calls: Pure Python file I/O
- No network access: File-local only
- No credential exposure: No passwords or tokens in status file

**Test Coverage**:
- Write operations: File creation, permission setting, temp file cleanup
- Read operations: Missing file, corrupted JSON, invalid field types
- Edge cases: Race conditions (atomic rename), permission errors, disk full
- Security: Path traversal attempts, symlink attacks, permission escalation
- Integration: Hook usage patterns, test runner integration

- docs/HOOKS.md - pre_commit_gate section (uses status_tracker)
- plugins/autonomous-dev/hooks/pre_commit_gate.py - Hook implementation

**Testing**:
```bash
# Self-test (included in module)
python plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/status_tracker.py

# Integrated tests

```

**Backward Compatibility**: N/A (new library)

**Version History**:
- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with atomic writes, secure permissions, graceful degradation

  4. Otherwise -> Return False
- **Features**:
  - TTY detection via sys.stdin.isatty()
  - Combines flag-based and environment-based detection
  - Detects CI environments without explicit flag
  - Detects piped input (not TTY)

#### `should_skip_prompts() -> bool`
- **Purpose**: Determine if interactive prompts should be skipped
- **Parameters**: None

  - 2: alignment_failed (error_type == "alignment_failed")
  - 3: tests_failed (error_type == "tests_failed")
  - 4: security_failed (error_type == "security_failed")
  - 5: timeout (error_type == "timeout")
- **Features**:

  - AUTO_GIT_ENABLED: "true" (enables git automation)
  - AUTO_GIT_PUSH: "true" (automatically pushes commits)
  - AUTO_GIT_PR: "false" (no auto-PR in CI, requires manual review)
  - Non-destructive: Does NOT override existing values
  - Returns dict of actual values (configured or existing)

### Design Patterns

- **Progressive Detection**: Flag -> CI environment -> TTY checks (most to least specific)
- **Non-blocking Enhancement**: Headless mode detection never fails, always returns safe defaults
- **Environment-aware**: Respects existing configuration, doesn't override user choices
- **Machine-friendly Output**: JSON format for CI/CD integration, standardized exit codes

### Security Considerations

- No external dependencies (uses only stdlib: os, sys, json)
- No file I/O operations (stateless detection)
- No subprocess calls (pure Python detection)
- No credential exposure (no environment variable logging)
- Case-insensitive CI environment detection (handles variations)
- Exit codes match POSIX conventions (0 = success, 1+ = error variants)

### Error Handling

- All functions return safe defaults (bool or dict) on any error
- No exceptions raised (graceful degradation)
- Missing environment variables treated as False
- Invalid status/error_type strings handled safely (default to generic error code 1)

### Performance

- detect_headless_flag(): less than 0.1ms (list membership check)
- detect_ci_environment(): less than 0.5ms (environment variable lookups)
- is_headless_mode(): less than 1ms (combined detection with TTY check)
- should_skip_prompts(): less than 1ms (calls is_headless_mode())
- format_json_output(): less than 1ms (JSON serialization)
- get_exit_code(): less than 0.1ms (dict lookup)
- configure_auto_git_for_headless(): less than 1ms (environment variable writes)

### Integration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Skip Interactive Prompts in Headless**
```python
from headless_mode import should_skip_prompts

if should_skip_prompts():
    response = "yes"
else:
    response = input("Continue? (yes/no): ")
```

**Pattern 2: JSON Output for CI/CD**
```python
from headless_mode import is_headless_mode, format_json_output

try:
    result = perform_workflow()
    output = format_json_output("success", {"feature": result})
except Exception as e:
    output = format_json_output("error", error=str(e))

if is_headless_mode():
    print(output)
else:
    print("Workflow completed successfully")
```

**Pattern 3: Exit Codes for CI/CD Integration**
```python
from headless_mode import get_exit_code, format_json_output

try:
    result = run_tests()
    if result.passed:
        output = format_json_output("success", {"tests": result.count})
        exit(get_exit_code("success"))
    else:
        output = format_json_output("error", error="Tests failed")
        exit(get_exit_code("error", "tests_failed"))
except TimeoutError:
    output = format_json_output("error", error="Timeout")
    exit(get_exit_code("error", "timeout"))
```

**Pattern 4: Auto-configure Git for Headless**
```python
from headless_mode import is_headless_mode, configure_auto_git_for_headless

if is_headless_mode():
    config = configure_auto_git_for_headless()
```

## 69. conflict_resolver.py (1016 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #183)

**AI-powered merge conflict resolution with three-tier escalation strategy**

### Purpose

Resolve git merge conflicts intelligently using Claude API. Handles conflicts from simple (whitespace) to complex (multi-conflict semantic issues) with automatic tier escalation.

### Problem

Merge conflicts interrupt development workflows. Manual resolution requires understanding code context, intent, and impact. Simple conflicts are tedious to resolve manually. Complex conflicts need semantic understanding.

### Solution

Three-tier escalation strategy balances automation with accuracy:

1. **Tier 1 (Auto-Merge)**: Trivial conflicts resolved without AI
   - Whitespace-only differences
   - Identical changes on both sides
   - Instant resolution, zero API cost

2. **Tier 2 (Conflict-Only)**: AI analyzes only conflict blocks
   - Focuses on semantic understanding of changes
   - Faster than full-file analysis
   - Suitable for most real conflicts

3. **Tier 3 (Full-File)**: Comprehensive context analysis
   - Reads entire file for maximum context
   - Handles complex multi-conflict scenarios
   - Chunks large files to respect API limits (100KB per chunk)

### Key Classes

**ConflictBlock**
- Represents a single merge conflict
- Tracks: file_path, start_line, end_line, their_changes, our_changes, base_version
- Extracts conflict range for targeted analysis

**ResolutionSuggestion**
- Recommended resolution with metadata
- Fields: file_path, start_line, end_line, resolved_content, confidence (0.0-1.0), reasoning, tier_used
- Applied atomically to file with backup

**ConflictResolutionResult**
- Final result of resolution attempt
- Fields: success (bool), resolution (optional ResolutionSuggestion), error_message, conflict_count, resolved_count

### Key Functions

**parse_conflict_markers(file_path)**
- Parses git conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
- Returns: List[ConflictBlock] with all conflicts found
- Validates file path (CWE-22, CWE-59 prevention)

**resolve_tier1_auto_merge(conflict: ConflictBlock)**
- Detects and resolves trivial conflicts
- Whitespace normalization
- Identical side detection
- Returns: Optional[ResolutionSuggestion] (None if needs escalation)

**resolve_tier2_conflict_only(conflict: ConflictBlock, api_key: str)**
- AI analysis of conflict block only
- Prompt: 200-300 tokens (conflict + reasoning request)
- Returns: ResolutionSuggestion with confidence scoring
- Suitable for 90% of conflicts

**resolve_tier3_full_file(file_path: str, conflicts: List[ConflictBlock], api_key: str)**
- AI analysis with entire file context
- Chunks large files (>100KB)
- Processes chunks sequentially with context preservation
- Returns: ConflictResolutionResult with all resolutions

**apply_resolution(file_path: str, resolution: ResolutionSuggestion)**
- Applies resolution to file
- Atomic operations: backup -> update -> verify
- Returns: bool (success/failure)
- Verifies conflict markers removed

**resolve_conflicts(file_path: str, api_key: str)**
- Main entry point with automatic tier escalation
- Implements escalation logic: Tier 1 -> Tier 2 -> Tier 3
- Returns: ConflictResolutionResult
- Handles all errors gracefully

### Three-Tier Strategy

**Why Escalation?**
- Tier 1 (instant) handles common cases
- Tier 2 (fast) handles most conflicts without full context
- Tier 3 (comprehensive) available for complex scenarios
- Reduces API cost while maintaining quality

**When to Use Each Tier**

| Scenario | Tier | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| Whitespace only | 1 | Instant, no AI needed |
| Identical changes | 1 | Deterministic resolution |
| Simple semantic conflict | 2 | Context from conflict block sufficient |
| Multiple conflicts | 2 | Tier 2 handles multiple blocks |
| Cross-cutting changes | 3 | Needs full file context |
| Complex refactoring | 3 | Semantic understanding requires file knowledge |

**Tier 2 vs Tier 3 Performance**
- Tier 2: ~3-5 seconds per conflict (200 tokens)
- Tier 3: ~5-10 seconds per file (500-1000 tokens depending on file size)
- Cost: Tier 2 ~100x cheaper than Tier 3

### Security Features

**Path Validation (CWE-22, CWE-59)**
- validate_path() checks for path traversal
- Symlink detection and rejection
- Absolute path normalization
- User project scope validation

**Log Injection Sanitization (CWE-117)**
- Sanitize conflict markers before logging
- Remove control characters and newlines
- Never log API keys or sensitive data

**API Key Protection**
- Never logged or printed
- Passed only to anthropic.Anthropic client
- Removed from error messages
- Used via environment variable (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

**Atomic File Operations**
- Backup created before modification
- Changes written to temporary file
- Atomic rename on success
- Rollback on failure

### Usage Example

```python
from conflict_resolver import resolve_conflicts, parse_conflict_markers

# Method 1: Automatic escalation (recommended)

    print(f"Confidence: {result.resolution.confidence:.0%}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {result.resolution.reasoning}")

```

### Integration with /worktree Command

The `--ai-merge` flag integrates conflict_resolver with worktree merge workflow:

```bash
# Merge worktree with AI conflict resolution
/worktree --merge my-feature --ai-merge

# Without AI (manual resolution)
/worktree --merge my-feature
```

**Requirements**:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable set
- Merge conflict(s) present
- User approves AI resolution (interactive prompt)

### Error Handling

- Returns ConflictResolutionResult.success = False on any error
- ConflictResolutionResult.error_message contains details
- Graceful degradation: Missing API key, rate limiting, network errors handled
- Backup preserved on failure for manual recovery

### Performance

- Tier 1: <100ms per conflict (no API)
- Tier 2: 3-5 seconds per conflict (one API call)
- Tier 3: 5-10 seconds per file (handles chunking)
- File I/O: ~10-50ms depending on file size
- Parallel: Can resolve multiple conflicts in single API call

### Design Patterns

- **Tier Escalation**: Start simple, escalate only when needed (cost optimization)
- **Atomic Operations**: Backup-modify-verify prevents corruption
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing API key doesn't crash, just fails with explanation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: API key only requested when needed (Tier 2+)

See library-design-patterns skill for standardized design patterns.

### Integration Points

**Command**: `/worktree --merge <feature> --ai-merge`
- Integrates conflict resolution into merge workflow
- Requires user consent before AI resolution
- Fallback to manual resolution if AI fails

**Other Libraries**: None currently (self-contained)

### Used By

- worktree_command.py - Integrates via --ai-merge flag
- merge_worktree() function in worktree_manager.py
- Future: Other merge workflows

### Test Coverage

- Tier 1 resolution: Whitespace, identical changes
- Tier 2 resolution: Single and multiple conflicts
- Tier 3 resolution: Full-file context, chunking
- Error cases: Missing file, invalid path, API errors
- Security: Path traversal, symlink detection, log injection
- Edge cases: Empty conflicts, very large files (>1MB), missing API key

### Version History

- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with three-tier escalation (Issue #183)

### Backward Compatibility

## 74. agent_pool.py (495 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #185)

**Scalable parallel agent pool with priority queue and token-aware rate limiting**

### Purpose

Execute multiple agents concurrently with intelligent task scheduling, priority queue management, token budget enforcement, and work-stealing load balancing. Enables scaling from 3 to 12 agents while preventing resource exhaustion.

### Problem

Sequential agent execution is slow. Parallel execution without coordination causes token budget exhaustion and resource contention. No mechanism to prioritize critical tasks (security, tests) over optional work.

### Solution

Scalable agent pool that manages concurrent execution with four key features:

1. **Priority Queue**: Tasks executed by priority (P1_SECURITY greater than P2_TESTS greater than P3_DOCS greater than P4_OPTIONAL)
2. **Token Tracking**: Sliding window budget enforcement prevents token exhaustion
3. **Work Stealing**: Agents pull tasks from queue based on availability (load balancing)
4. **Graceful Failures**: Timeouts and partial results handled cleanly

### Key Classes

**PriorityLevel (Enum)**
- P1_SECURITY: Highest priority (security-critical tasks)
- P2_TESTS: High priority (test generation)
- P3_DOCS: Medium priority (documentation)
- P4_OPTIONAL: Low priority (optional enhancements)

**TaskHandle**
- Represents submitted task
- Fields: task_id, agent_type, priority, submitted_at
- Returned from submit_task() for result tracking

**AgentResult**
- Result from completed task
- Fields: task_id, success, output, tokens_used, duration
- Contains agent output and execution metrics

**PoolStatus**
- Current pool execution state
- Fields: active_tasks, queued_tasks, completed_tasks, token_usage
- Used for monitoring and debugging

**AgentPool**
- Main pool coordinator
- Manages worker threads, task queue, token tracking, result storage
- Thread-safe with internal locking mechanisms

### Key Functions

**AgentPool.__init__(config: PoolConfig)**
- Initialize pool with configuration
- Starts worker threads
- Sets up token tracking
- Raises ValueError if config invalid

**AgentPool.submit_task(agent_type, prompt, priority, estimated_tokens)**
- Submit task to pool for execution
- Args: agent_type (string), prompt (string, less than 10,000 chars), priority (PriorityLevel), estimated_tokens (optional, default 5000)
- Returns: TaskHandle for tracking
- Raises: ValueError (invalid input), RuntimeError (token budget exhausted)
- CWE-22: Validates agent_type pattern prevents path traversal
- CWE-770: Enforces prompt size limit prevents resource exhaustion

**AgentPool.await_all(handles, timeout)**
- Wait for all submitted tasks to complete
- Args: handles (List[TaskHandle]), timeout (optional, seconds)
- Returns: List[AgentResult] (in same order as input handles)
- Raises: TimeoutError if timeout exceeded
- Blocks until all results available or timeout

**AgentPool.get_pool_status()**
- Get current pool execution state
- Returns: PoolStatus with active/queued/completed task counts and token usage
- Non-blocking, real-time status

**AgentPool.shutdown()**
- Gracefully shutdown pool
- Waits for active tasks to complete (5-second timeout per worker)
- Stops accepting new submissions
- Cleans up worker threads

### Design Patterns

- **Priority Queue**: Queue.PriorityQueue with (priority, submission_time, task_id, task_data) tuple ordering
- **Sliding Window**: TokenTracker manages token budget with time-based expiration
- **Work Stealing**: Worker threads pull tasks based on availability (natural load balancing)
- **Thread Safety**: Lock-protected access to shared state (results, status)
- **Graceful Failures**: Timeouts return partial results, exceptions captured per task

### Security Features

**Path Validation (CWE-22)**
- agent_type validated against regex pattern matching ^[a-z0-9_-]+$
- Prevents path traversal via agent type field
- Explicit error message on invalid input

**Resource Limit (CWE-400)**
- Hard cap at 12 concurrent agents (max_agents parameter)
- Token budget enforcement via sliding window
- Reject submissions exceeding budget
- Default 150,000 token budget

**Resource Limit (CWE-770)**
- Prompt size limited to 10,000 characters
- Prevents excessive memory/API usage
- Validated on submission

**Thread Safety**
- Results locked with threading.Lock
- Status locked with threading.Lock
- Supports concurrent agent execution

### Usage Example

```
from agent_pool import AgentPool, PriorityLevel
from pool_config import PoolConfig

# Create pool with 6 agents and 150K token budget
config = PoolConfig(max_agents=6, token_budget=150000)
pool = AgentPool(config=config)

# Submit high-priority security task
security_handle = pool.submit_task(
    agent_type="security-auditor",
    prompt="Audit new authentication module for vulnerabilities",
    priority=PriorityLevel.P1_SECURITY,
    estimated_tokens=8000
)

# Submit medium-priority doc task
doc_handle = pool.submit_task(
    agent_type="doc-master",
    prompt="Update API documentation for new endpoint",
    priority=PriorityLevel.P3_DOCS,
    estimated_tokens=5000
)

# Wait for all tasks to complete
results = pool.await_all([security_handle, doc_handle], timeout=60.0)

# Process results
for result in results:
    if result.success:
        print(f"Task {result.task_id} completed in {result.duration:.1f}s ({result.tokens_used} tokens)")
        print(f"Output: {result.output}")
    else:
        print(f"Task {result.task_id} failed")

# Get pool status
status = pool.get_pool_status()
print(f"Active: {status.active_tasks}, Queued: {status.queued_tasks}, Complete: {status.completed_tasks}")

# Shutdown
pool.shutdown()
```

### Integration Points

**Commands**:
- `/implement` - May use for parallel validation phase (reviewer + security-auditor + doc-master)
- `/implement --batch` - May use for per-feature parallel agents

**Agents**:
- All agents can be submitted to pool (researcher, planner, implementer, test-master, reviewer, security-auditor, doc-master, etc.)
- Agent type must match valid agent names

**Libraries**:
- PoolConfig (configuration management) - Required
- TokenTracker (token budget enforcement) - Required
- Task (Claude Code Task tool) - External dependency for execution

### Performance

- Task submission: less than 1ms (queue insertion)
- Await all: Depends on task duration (typically 2-30 minutes per task)
- Pool startup: approximately 10ms (thread creation)
- Pool shutdown: 5-25 seconds (worker join timeout)
- Memory overhead: approximately 1KB per task in queue

### Test Coverage

- Task submission and validation (agent type, prompt size, token budget)
- Priority queue ordering (P1 greater than P2 greater than P3 greater than P4)
- Token budget enforcement (reject over-budget submissions)
- Concurrent task execution (worker threads)
- Result collection and ordering
- Pool status tracking
- Graceful shutdown
- Security: Path traversal prevention, resource limits
- Error handling: Timeout, invalid config, budget exceeded

### Version History

- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with priority queue and token tracking (Issue #185)

### Backward Compatibility

N/A (new library - Issue #185)

## 75. pool_config.py (196 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #185)

**Agent pool configuration with validation and loading**

### Purpose

Manage agent pool configuration with support for defaults, environment variables, and PROJECT.md loading. Provides validated configuration for AgentPool initialization.

### Problem

Agent pool needs configurable max concurrency and token budget. Configuration should support multiple sources (defaults, env vars, PROJECT.md) with validation and graceful degradation.

### Solution

PoolConfig dataclass with multi-source loading and validation:
- Constructor arguments (highest priority)
- Environment variables (AGENT_POOL_*)
- PROJECT.md file (Agent Pool Configuration section)
- Built-in defaults (fallback)

### Key Classes

**PoolConfig**
- Dataclass holding pool configuration
- Fields: max_agents (3-12), token_budget (positive), priority_enabled (bool), token_window_seconds (positive)
- Validates on instantiation via __post_init__
- Provides class methods for loading from multiple sources

### Key Functions

**PoolConfig.__init__(max_agents, token_budget, priority_enabled, token_window_seconds)**
- Initialize configuration with defaults or custom values
- Validates all parameters in __post_init__
- Raises ValueError if validation fails

**PoolConfig._validate()**
- Validate configuration values
- Checks: max_agents (3-12 range), token_budget (greater than 0), token_window_seconds (greater than 0)
- Raises ValueError with descriptive message on failure

**PoolConfig.load_from_env()**
- Load configuration from environment variables
- Variables: AGENT_POOL_MAX_AGENTS, AGENT_POOL_TOKEN_BUDGET, AGENT_POOL_PRIORITY_ENABLED, AGENT_POOL_TOKEN_WINDOW_SECONDS
- Uses constructor defaults as fallback
- Returns: PoolConfig instance
- Raises ValueError if validation fails

**PoolConfig.load_from_project(project_root)**
- Load configuration from PROJECT.md file
- Searches for Agent Pool Configuration JSON block
- Format: max_agents, token_budget, priority_enabled, token_window_seconds
- Falls back to defaults if not found
- Returns: PoolConfig instance
- Graceful degradation on parse errors

### Configuration Sources Priority

1. Constructor arguments (highest - explicit values)
2. Environment variables (AGENT_POOL_* override defaults)
3. PROJECT.md (Agent Pool Configuration section)
4. Built-in defaults (fallback - max_agents=6, token_budget=150000, priority_enabled=true, token_window_seconds=60)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Valid Range | Default |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| AGENT_POOL_MAX_AGENTS | Max concurrent agents | 3-12 | 6 |
| AGENT_POOL_TOKEN_BUDGET | Token budget for window | Positive | 150000 |
| AGENT_POOL_PRIORITY_ENABLED | Enable priority queue | true/false | true |
| AGENT_POOL_TOKEN_WINDOW_SECONDS | Sliding window duration | Positive | 60 |

### Security Features

**Input Validation**
- Type checking (int, bool)
- Range validation (max_agents: 3-12)
- Positive value checking (token_budget, token_window_seconds)
- Descriptive error messages

**Graceful Degradation**
- Invalid PROJECT.md doesn't crash, falls back to env/defaults
- Missing env vars use defaults
- Parse errors logged and ignored

**No External Dependencies**
- Pure Python dataclass
- No network calls
- No subprocess execution

### Usage Example

```
from pool_config import PoolConfig
from pathlib import Path

# Use defaults
config = PoolConfig()
print(f"Default: {config.max_agents} agents, {config.token_budget} token budget")

# Load from environment
config = PoolConfig.load_from_env()

# Load from PROJECT.md with fallback
config = PoolConfig.load_from_project(Path(".claude/PROJECT.md"))

# Custom values
config = PoolConfig(max_agents=8, token_budget=200000)

# Pass to AgentPool
from agent_pool import AgentPool
pool = AgentPool(config=config)
```

### Integration Points

**AgentPool**: Required configuration parameter
**Commands**: `/implement`, `/implement --batch` may read config

### Performance

- Load from env: less than 1ms (os.getenv + int conversion)
- Load from PROJECT.md: 5-10ms (file I/O + JSON parsing)
- Validation: less than 1ms (range checks)
- Total overhead: Negligible compared to agent execution

### Test Coverage

- Default construction and validation
- Environment variable loading and override
- PROJECT.md loading and parsing
- Validation: Range checks, positive values, type checking
- Graceful degradation: Missing/invalid sources
- Error messages and exception types

### Version History

- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with multi-source loading (Issue #185)

### Backward Compatibility

N/A (new library - Issue #185)

## 76. token_tracker.py (177 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #185)

**Token-aware rate limiting with sliding window**

### Purpose

Track token usage across multiple agents with sliding time window to enforce budget limits and prevent token exhaustion during parallel execution.

### Problem

Parallel agent execution can quickly exhaust token budget without rate limiting. Need mechanism to track total usage, allow budget enforcement, and prevent over-submission.

### Solution

Token tracker with sliding window approach:
- Records usage per agent with timestamp
- Expires old records automatically based on time window
- Enforces budget by rejecting submissions exceeding remaining budget
- Provides usage breakdown by agent for monitoring

### Key Classes

**UsageRecord**
- Represents single token usage event
- Fields: agent_id, tokens, timestamp
- Used internally for sliding window tracking

**TokenTracker**
- Main tracking class
- Manages budget enforcement and usage tracking
- Thread-safe for concurrent agent access

### Key Functions

**TokenTracker.__init__(budget, window_seconds)**
- Initialize tracker with budget and window
- Args: budget (positive int), window_seconds (positive int, default 60)
- Raises ValueError if budget or window_seconds non-positive
- Sets up empty usage records list

**TokenTracker.record_usage(agent_id, tokens)**
- Record token usage for an agent
- Args: agent_id (string), tokens (int)
- Creates UsageRecord with current timestamp
- Appends to usage_records list
- Logs debug message

**TokenTracker.can_submit(estimated_tokens)**
- Check if submission would exceed budget
- Args: estimated_tokens (int)
- Returns: bool (True if within budget, False otherwise)
- Cleans up expired records before checking
- Non-blocking check

**TokenTracker.get_remaining_budget()**
- Get remaining token budget in current window
- Returns: int (remaining budget, greater than or equal to 0)
- Cleans up expired records first
- Calculates total usage in window and subtracts from budget

**TokenTracker._cleanup_expired_records()**
- Remove records outside sliding window
- Private method called before budget checks
- Removes records with timestamp greater than window_seconds ago
- Uses datetime.now() for current time

**TokenTracker.get_usage_by_agent()**
- Get per-agent token usage breakdown
- Returns: Dict[str, int] (agent_id to total tokens)
- Cleans up expired records first
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

### Sliding Window Design

**How it works**:
1. Each token usage recorded with timestamp
2. Before budget check, expired records removed (older than window_seconds)
3. Remaining records summed for total usage
4. Remaining budget = budget - total_usage
5. Submission allowed if remaining greater than or equal to estimated_tokens

**Why it works**:
- Allows temporary spikes within window
- Automatic expiration prevents permanent budget exhaustion
- Window defaults to 60 seconds (configurable)
- Per-agent tracking enables usage monitoring

**Example**:
Budget: 150,000 tokens, Window: 60 seconds

At T=0:
  - Agent A uses 50,000 tokens
  - Remaining: 100,000

At T=30:
  - Agent B uses 70,000 tokens
  - Total usage: 120,000
  - Remaining: 30,000

At T=65:
  - Agent A's usage expired (recorded at T=0, now greater than 60s old)
  - Remaining usage: 70,000 (only Agent B)
  - Remaining budget: 80,000

### Security Features

**Budget Enforcement (CWE-400)**
- Hard budget limits prevent token exhaustion
- Reject submissions exceeding available budget
- Per-agent tracking prevents single agent hogging budget

**No External Dependencies**
- Pure Python implementation
- No network calls
- No subprocess execution
- No file I/O

**Thread-Safe**
- Uses datetime for consistent timestamps
- Stateless operations (no race conditions on list operations in CPython)
- Safe for concurrent agent access

### Usage Example

```
from token_tracker import TokenTracker

# Create tracker: 150K token budget, 60-second window
tracker = TokenTracker(budget=150000, window_seconds=60)

# Check if can submit task
if tracker.can_submit(estimated_tokens=10000):
    # Submit task...
    # After execution, record actual usage
    tracker.record_usage(agent_id="researcher", tokens=8500)
else:
    print("Token budget exhausted, cannot submit new tasks")

# Check remaining budget
remaining = tracker.get_remaining_budget()
print(f"Remaining budget: {remaining} tokens")

# Monitor per-agent usage
usage_by_agent = tracker.get_usage_by_agent()
for agent_id, tokens in usage_by_agent.items():
    print(f"Agent {agent_id}: {tokens} tokens")

# Usage expires automatically after window
# At T=65 seconds, records from T=0 automatically removed
```

### Integration Points

**AgentPool**: Required for token budget enforcement
**PoolConfig**: Provides window_seconds configuration

### Performance

- Record usage: less than 1ms (append to list)
- Get remaining budget: 1-5ms (cleanup + summation, depends on record count)
- Can submit check: 1-5ms (cleanup + comparison)
- Cleanup: O(n) where n equals records in window (typically 1-20 records)

### Test Coverage

- Tracker initialization with valid/invalid budgets
- Recording usage and timestamp tracking
- Can_submit budget checking and remaining calculation
- Usage expiration and cleanup (time-based)
- Per-agent usage breakdown
- Thread safety with concurrent operations
- Edge cases: Empty records, zero budget, very large usage

## 77. ideation_engine.py (431 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #186)

### Purpose

Orchestrates automated discovery of improvement opportunities across code quality, security, performance, accessibility, and technical debt through multi-category analysis.

### Problem

Manual code review is time-consuming and misses systemic issues. Development teams need automated suggestions for improvements without running separate tools for each category (security scanners, linters, complexity checkers, etc.). Single-category tools miss cross-cutting improvements.

## 84. parallel_validation.py (753 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #188)

### Purpose

Migrates /implement STEP 4.1 parallel validation from prompt engineering to reusable agent_pool library integration. Provides unified parallel validation execution for security-auditor, reviewer, and doc-master agents with security-first priority mode, automatic retry logic, and result aggregation.

### Problem

Previously, /implement Step 4.1 parallel validation relied on prompt engineering and manual coordination within the conversation. This approach:
- Tight coupling between /implement and validation logic
- No reusability for other workflows needing parallel validation
- Manual retry logic and error handling
- Difficult to test in isolation
- Hard to optimize performance independently

### Solution

Dedicated parallel_validation library that:
- Encapsulates validation orchestration in reusable functions
- Integrates with AgentPool library for scalable parallel execution
- Provides security-first priority mode (security blocks on failure)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (transient vs permanent error classification)
- Result aggregation and parsing from agent outputs
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Key Classes

**ValidationResults** (dataclass)
- security_passed: bool - Security audit pass/fail status
- review_passed: bool - Code review pass/fail status
- docs_updated: bool - Documentation update status
- failed_agents: List[str] - List of agent types that failed
- execution_time_seconds: float - Total execution time
- security_output: str - Raw security agent output
- review_output: str - Raw reviewer output
- docs_output: str - Raw doc-master output

### Key Functions

**execute_parallel_validation()**
- Main entry point for parallel validation
- Args: feature_description, project_root, priority_mode, changed_files, max_retries
- Returns: ValidationResults
- Raises: ValueError (invalid input), SecurityValidationError (security failure in priority mode), ValidationTimeoutError (all agents timeout)
- Behavior: Coordinates agent pool execution and result aggregation

**_execute_security_first()**
- Security-first priority mode execution
- Phase 1: Runs security agent first (blocking)
- Phase 2: If security passes, runs reviewer + doc-master in parallel
- Raises: SecurityValidationError if security audit fails
- Rationale: Security failures should block feature implementation immediately

**_aggregate_results()**
- Parses agent outputs and aggregates into ValidationResults
- Looks for "PASS"/"FAIL" in security-auditor output
- Looks for "APPROVE"/"REQUEST_CHANGES" in reviewer output
- Looks for "UPDATED" in doc-master output
- Handles missing results with appropriate defaults
- Returns: ValidationResults with aggregated status

**retry_with_backoff()**
- Executes agent task with automatic retry on transient errors
- Exponential backoff: 2^n seconds (2s, 4s, 8s, ...)
- Transient errors (timeout, connection) - automatically retried
- Permanent errors (syntax, import, type) - fail fast
- Args: pool, agent_type, prompt, max_retries, priority
- Returns: AgentResult from successful execution
- Raises: Exception on permanent error or max retries exceeded

**is_transient_error()**
- Classify error as transient (should retry)
- Returns: True for TimeoutError, ConnectionError, HTTP 5xx patterns
- Returns: False for permanent errors

**is_permanent_error()**
- Classify error as permanent (fail fast)
- Returns: True for SyntaxError, ImportError, ValueError, PermissionError, TypeError, KeyError, AttributeError
- Returns: False for transient errors

### Key Features

**Parallel Validation Modes**:
- All parallel mode (default): All three agents run simultaneously
- Security-first mode: Security runs first, blocks on failure, then parallel validation

**Automatic Retry**:
- Transient error detection (timeout, network, HTTP 5xx)
- Permanent error detection (syntax, import, type)
- Exponential backoff (2^n seconds)
- Circuit breaker: max_retries limit (default 3)

**Result Aggregation**:
- Parse agent outputs from free-form text
- Track execution time from AgentResult.duration
- Aggregate failures with detailed error messages
- Handle missing agents with appropriate fallbacks

**Security-First Priority**:
- Security agent runs first
- If security fails, raises SecurityValidationError immediately
- Blocks reviewer and doc-master from executing
- Prevents unsafe code from being approved

**Input Validation**:
- Feature description validation (non-empty)
- Project root path validation (Path object, exists)
- File path validation (format check)

### Security Features

**CWE-22 (Path Traversal Prevention)**:
- project_root must be Path object
- project_root.exists() validated
- Only relative paths in changed_files (no absolute paths)

**Input Validation**:
- Feature description non-empty check
- Path object type validation
- File path format validation

**Error Classification**:
- Transient vs permanent error detection
- Prevents retry loops on permanent errors
- Protects against infinite backoff

### Integration Points

**AgentPool Library** (Issue #185)
- Uses AgentPool.submit_task() for agent execution
- Uses AgentPool.await_all() for result retrieval
- Respects PriorityLevel (P1_SECURITY, P2_TESTS, P3_DOCS)
- Gracefully handles pool initialization

**auto-implement Command**
- Called from /implement Step 4.1 (parallel validation phase)
- Replaces prompt engineering with library call
- Passes feature description, project root, changed files

**PoolConfig Library** (Issue #185)
- Uses PoolConfig.load_from_env() for configuration
- Supports environment-based pool settings

### Performance

**Baseline** (3 agents parallel):
- Execution time: 2-5 minutes (depends on agent response time)
- Security audit: 60-90 seconds
- Code review: 45-60 seconds
- Documentation: 45-60 seconds
- Total (parallel): approximately 90 seconds (wall clock, not sequential sum)

**Retry Performance Impact**:
- Transient error retry: +2s per retry (exponential backoff)
- Permanent error: immediate fail (no backoff)
- Typical: 1 retry needed in 5 percent of cases

### Test Coverage

- ValidationResults dataclass creation and serialization
- execute_parallel_validation() with valid/invalid inputs
- _execute_security_first() security blocking behavior

### Backward Compatibility


## 85. ralph_loop_manager.py (305 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #189)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate self-correcting agent execution with retry loops, circuit breaker pattern, and token usage tracking.

**Problem**: Agents sometimes complete tasks incompletely or fail silently. Manual retry coordination is error-prone, and cost overruns from infinite loops are possible.

**Solution**: Ralph Loop Manager that tracks iterations, enforces circuit breaker on consecutive failures, limits token usage, and determines when to allow retry vs. blocking further attempts.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/ralph_loop_manager.py`

**Key Features**:
- Iteration tracking (max 5 iterations per session)
- Circuit breaker pattern (3 consecutive failures blocks retry)
- Token usage tracking (prevents cost overruns)
- Thread-safe state operations with atomic writes
- Graceful degradation for corrupted state files

**Constants**:
- `MAX_ITERATIONS = 5` - Maximum retry attempts per session
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD = 3` - Consecutive failures to trigger circuit breaker
- `DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT = 50000` - Token limit for entire loop

**Key Classes**:
- `RalphLoopState` (dataclass) - Tracks session state (current iteration, tokens used, consecutive failures, circuit breaker status, retry_history)
  - **retry_history** (NEW v3.48.0): List of retry attempt records with timestamp, iteration, tokens, status
- `RalphLoopManager` - Main orchestrator with methods:
  - `record_attempt(tokens_used)` - Record token consumption for attempt
  - `should_retry()` - Check if retry allowed (respects max iterations, circuit breaker, token limit)
  - `record_success()` - Record successful completion
  - `record_failure(error_msg)` - Record failure and check circuit breaker
  - `get_state()` - Get current state for inspection
  - `reset_state()` - Reset for new session

**Retry Decision Logic**:
1. Check max iterations (5 iterations -> block)
2. Check circuit breaker (3 consecutive failures -> block)
3. Check token limit (exceeded -> block)
4. If all checks pass -> allow retry

**Security Features**:
- Atomic state file writes (temp + rename to prevent corruption)
- Thread-safe operations with locks
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Graceful degradation for corrupted state files (logs warning, continues)
- No code execution from user input

**API Highlights**:
```python
from ralph_loop_manager import RalphLoopManager, MAX_ITERATIONS, CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD

# Create manager for session
manager = RalphLoopManager("session-123", token_limit=50000)

# Record attempt with tokens
manager.record_attempt(tokens_used=5000)

# Check if should retry
if manager.should_retry():
    # Retry execution
    try:
        # Run agent task
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        manager.record_failure(str(e))
else:
    # Stop (max iterations, circuit breaker, or token limit)
    print("Retry blocked: " + manager.get_state().stop_reason)

# Record success
manager.record_success()
```

**State Persistence**:
- State stored in `~/.autonomous-dev/ralph_loop_sessions/[session-id].json`
- Portable path detection works from any directory
- Atomic writes prevent corruption on crash

**Test Coverage**:
- RalphLoopState creation and serialization
- RalphLoopManager initialization and state management
- should_retry() with various state conditions
- record_attempt() token tracking
- record_failure() circuit breaker triggering
- Thread safety with concurrent operations
- State file corruption handling

**Version History**:
- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release for self-correcting agent execution (Issue #189)

**Dependencies**:
- Standard library: json, threading, tempfile, pathlib, dataclasses, datetime

**Files Added**:
- plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/ralph_loop_manager.py (305 lines)
- tests/unit/lib/test_ralph_loop_manager.py (test suite)

## 86. success_criteria_validator.py (432 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #189)

**Purpose**: Provide multiple validation strategies to determine if agent task completed successfully.

**Problem**: Different tasks need different validation approaches. Some need test verification (pytest), others need file existence checks, and still others need output parsing. Each agent implements validation differently, leading to inconsistency and bugs.

**Solution**: Unified validator library supporting five validation strategies with security hardening, timeout enforcement, and clear success/failure messages.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/success_criteria_validator.py`

**Key Features**:
- Multiple validation strategies (pytest, safe_word, file_existence, regex, json)
- Security validations (path traversal, ReDoS, command injection)
- Timeout enforcement for long-running operations
- Thread-safe operation
- Clear success/failure messages with context

**Validation Strategies**:

1. **Pytest Strategy**
   - Runs pytest and checks pass/fail
   - Timeout: 60 seconds by default (v3.48.0, increased from 30s)
   - Configurable via PYTEST_TIMEOUT environment variable (e.g., PYTEST_TIMEOUT=120)
   - Returns test output and status
   - Use case: Unit/integration test verification

2. **Safe Word Strategy**
   - Searches for completion marker in agent output
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Returns match position and context
   - Use case: Agent output verification (e.g., "TASK_COMPLETE")

3. **File Existence Strategy**
   - Verifies all expected files exist
   - Checks file paths, rejects symlinks (CWE-59)
   - Returns list of missing files
   - Use case: Output file verification

4. **Regex Strategy**
   - Extracts data via regex pattern
   - ReDoS prevention (1 second timeout)
   - Validates extracted value against expected
   - Use case: Structured output validation

5. **JSON Strategy**
   - Extracts data via JSONPath expression
   - Validates extracted value against expected
   - Provides detailed error context
   - Use case: JSON response validation

**Constants**:
- `DEFAULT_PYTEST_TIMEOUT = 60` - Timeout for pytest runs (v3.48.0: increased from 30s for slower test suites)
- `REGEX_TIMEOUT = 1` - Timeout for regex operations (prevent ReDoS)

**Environment Variables** (NEW v3.48.0, Issue #256):
- `PYTEST_TIMEOUT` - Override DEFAULT_PYTEST_TIMEOUT per test run (e.g., PYTEST_TIMEOUT=120)
- Checked only when timeout not explicitly provided to validate_pytest()
- Allows per-environment tuning (local dev, CI/CD, slow hardware)

**Key Functions**:
```python
# Pytest validation
success, message = validate_pytest("tests/test_feature.py", timeout=10)

# Safe word validation
success, message = validate_safe_word(agent_output, safe_word="SAFE_WORD_COMPLETE")

# File existence validation
success, message = validate_file_existence(["output.txt", "data.json"])

# Output parsing validation
success, message = validate_output_parsing(
    agent_output,
    strategy="regex",
    pattern=r"Result: (\d+)",
    expected="42"
)
```

**Security Features**:
- Path traversal prevention (CWE-22): Validates paths exist and are files/directories
- Symlink rejection (CWE-59): Rejects symlinks to prevent TOCTOU attacks
- Command injection prevention (CWE-78): Uses subprocess.run with list arguments (no shell=True)
- ReDoS prevention: Regex operations timeout after 1 second
- Input validation: Validates patterns, paths, JSONPath expressions
- No code execution from user input

**Validation Result**:
```python
class ValidationResult:
    # Result of validation attempt.
    success: bool          # True if validation passed
    message: str           # Human-readable result message
    strategy: str          # Which strategy was used
    details: Dict          # Additional context (matches, file list, etc.)
    duration_seconds: float # How long validation took
```

**API Highlights**:
```python
from success_criteria_validator import validate_success, validate_pytest

# Generic validator (auto-selects strategy based on criteria type)
result = validate_success(
    criteria={
        "strategy": "pytest",
        "test_file": "tests/test_auth.py"
    }
)

# Specific validator
result = validate_pytest("tests/test_auth.py", timeout=30)

# Check result
if result.success:
    print(f"PASS: {result.message}")
else:
    print(f"FAIL: {result.message}")
    print(f"Details: {result.details}")
```

**Test Coverage**:
- validate_pytest() with passing/failing tests
- validate_safe_word() with various outputs
- validate_file_existence() with existing/missing files
- validate_output_parsing() with regex/json strategies
- Security: Path traversal rejection, symlink detection, injection prevention
- Timeout enforcement for long operations
- Edge cases: Empty patterns, missing files, malformed JSON
- Performance: Validation speed benchmarks

**Version History**:
- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with five validation strategies (Issue #189)

**Dependencies**:
- Standard library: json, subprocess, re, pathlib, typing, signal, os

**Files Added**:
- plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/success_criteria_validator.py (432 lines)
- tests/unit/lib/test_success_criteria_validator.py (test suite)

## 87. agent_feedback.py (946 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #191)

**Purpose**: Machine learning feedback loop for intelligent agent routing optimization based on historical performance metrics.

**Problem**: Agent selection is static. Planner assigns agents without data about their performance on similar tasks. This leads to suboptimal routing and missed optimization opportunities.

**Solution**: Feedback loop system that:
1. Records agent performance after each feature (duration, success, feature type, complexity)
2. Queries historical data to recommend optimal agents for new features
3. Maintains aggregated statistics by agent/feature-type/complexity combination
4. Provides fallback agent suggestions when primary recommendation has low confidence
5. Automatically prunes old data (90-day retention) with monthly aggregation

**Key Features**:

1. **Feature Type Classification**: 7 categories (security, api, ui, refactor, docs, tests, general)
   - Keyword-based classification (e.g., "auth", "oauth" → security)
   - Fallback to "general" for unmatched features
   - Configurable keyword patterns per category

2. **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical confidence metric
   - Formula: confidence = success_rate * sqrt(min(executions, 50) / 50)
   - Low confidence (less than 10 executions): 0.0-0.5
   - Medium confidence (30 executions): 0.77 with 100% success
   - High confidence plateau (50+ executions): success_rate as limiting factor
   - Ensures recommendations backed by sufficient data

3. **Smart Routing**: Query optimal agents per feature
   - Top N recommendations (sorted by confidence)
   - Fallback agents for redundancy
   - Reasoning explanation for each recommendation
   - Success rates and execution counts included

4. **Data Aggregation**: Monthly aggregation of old feedback
   - Preserves daily feedback for recent data (90-day window)
   - Aggregates older data by month for retention
   - Automatically runs during cleanup operations
   - Maintains queryability across all time ranges

5. **Atomic Writes**: Crash-proof state persistence
   - Tempfile + atomic rename (prevents corruption on crash)
   - Lock-based coordination for concurrent access
   - Graceful error handling for corrupted state files
   - Audit logging for all state changes

6. **Security Hardening**:
   - CWE-22 (path traversal): Path validation and exists() checks
   - Input validation: agent_name, complexity, duration, feature types
   - Sanitization: Feature descriptions and metadata
   - No code execution from user input
   - Audit trail logging for all operations

**Dataclasses**:

Single feedback entry (AgentFeedback):
- agent_name: Name of executing agent
- feature_type: Type of feature (security, api, ui, refactor, docs, tests, general)
- complexity: Feature complexity (SIMPLE, STANDARD, COMPLEX)
- duration: Execution time in minutes
- success: Whether agent completed successfully
- timestamp: ISO 8601 timestamp (auto-added)
- metadata: Additional context (owasp_checks, coverage, etc.)

Aggregated statistics (FeedbackStats):
- success_rate: Percentage of successful executions (0.0-1.0)
- avg_duration: Average execution time in minutes
- executions: Total execution count
- last_execution: ISO 8601 timestamp of most recent execution
- confidence: Confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on data volume

Recommendation with fallbacks (RoutingRecommendation):
- agent_name: Primary recommended agent
- confidence: Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- reasoning: Explanation of recommendation
- fallback_agents: Backup agents if primary unavailable
- stats: Performance metrics for this agent

**State File Structure** (.claude/agent_feedback.json):

JSON structure with version, feedback array, and aggregated monthly statistics:
- version: "1.0"
- feedback: Array of AgentFeedback entries with agent_name, feature_type, complexity, duration, success, timestamp, metadata
- aggregated: Nested object by month/agent/feature_type/complexity with total_executions, success_count, total_duration

**Public API**:

Key functions:
- record_feedback(agent_name, feature_type, complexity, duration, success, metadata=None) - Record agent performance after task completion
- query_recommendations(feature_type, complexity, top_n=3) - Get recommended agents for a feature
- get_agent_stats(agent_name) - Get statistics for specific agent
- classify_feature_type(description) - Classify feature type from description
- cleanup_old_data() - Prune expired data and aggregate old feedback

Usage:
- Record performance after agent completes
- Query recommendations when planning next features
- Classify features automatically from descriptions
- Run periodic cleanup for maintenance

**Usage Example** (Integration in /implement):

After security-auditor completes:
1. Record the execution with agent_name, feature_type, complexity, duration, success flag
2. For future features, planner queries recommendations for security/STANDARD
3. Suggests agents to use based on historical performance

**Constants**:

- DATA_RETENTION_DAYS = 90: Keep daily feedback for 90 days
- CONFIDENCE_SCALE_FACTOR = 50: Executions needed to reach high confidence
- DEFAULT_TOP_N = 3: Default number of recommendations to return
- FEEDBACK_FILE = ".claude/agent_feedback.json"

**Integration Points**:

1. Planner Agent: Query recommendations when assigning agents
2. Agent Exit: Record feedback after agent completion (SubagentStop hook)
3. Maintenance: Periodic cleanup via /health-check command
4. Reporting: Session reports include feedback statistics

**Test Coverage** (73 tests total):

## 88. memory_relevance.py (287 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #192)

Purpose: TF-IDF-based relevance scoring for cross-session memories enabling intelligent retrieval of contextually relevant memories from previous sessions.

Problem: Memory injection needs intelligent filtering to avoid context bloat. Too many irrelevant memories waste tokens; too few memories reduce context continuity. No built-in relevance scoring.

Solution: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scoring system that:
1. Extracts keywords from query using stopword removal
2. Calculates relevance scores between query and memory content
3. Applies recency boost to favor recent memories
4. Filters low-relevance memories using threshold (configurable)
5. Returns ranked memories sorted by relevance score (highest first)

Key Features:

1. Keyword Extraction:
   - Extracts keywords from text using simple TF-IDF tokenization
   - Removes stopwords (common words like the, and, to)
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Returns sorted list of unique keywords

2. Relevance Scoring:
   - TF-IDF formula: overlap_ratio * recency_boost
   - overlap_ratio: Count of matching keywords / total keywords in query
   - Recency boost: 1.0 + (days_old / 30) up to 1.3 max bonus
   - Range: 0.0 (no match) to 1.3 (perfect match + recent)
   - Timestamp-aware (expects ISO 8601 format)

3. Memory Ranking:
   - Sorts memories by relevance score (descending)
   - Filters memories below threshold (default 0.3)
   - Preserves original memory structure with added relevance_score
   - Returns empty list if no matches meet threshold

4. Threshold Filtering:
   - Default threshold: 0.3 (allows partial matches)
   - Configurable per call via threshold parameter
   - High thresholds (0.7+) only include high-relevance memories
   - Low thresholds (0.1) include most memories

Public API:

Key functions:
- extract_keywords(text: str) - Extract keywords from text
- calculate_relevance(query: str, memory_text: str, timestamp: str) - Calculate relevance score between query and memory
- rank_memories(query: str, memories: List, threshold: float) - Rank and filter memories by relevance

Constants:

- STOPWORDS - Set of common English stopwords
- RECENCY_BOOST_MAX = 1.3 - Maximum boost for recent memories
- RECENCY_BOOST_SCALE = 30 - Days to reach max boost
- DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0.3 - Minimum relevance score

Integration Points:

1. Memory Injection: Used by auto_inject_memory.py to filter relevant memories
2. Formatting: Ranked memories passed to memory_formatter.py for token-aware formatting
3. SessionStart Hook: Called during memory injection at session start

Test Coverage (32 tests):

Unit Tests:
- extract_keywords() with various text inputs, stopword filtering
- calculate_relevance() with exact/partial/no matches, timestamp variations
- rank_memories() with threshold filtering, sorting, edge cases

## 89. memory_formatter.py (261 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #192)

Purpose: Token-aware formatting for memories with budget constraints enabling cost-effective memory injection while preventing context bloat.

Problem: Memory injection must respect token budget to prevent context bloat. No built-in token counting or budget-aware formatting. Memories must be formatted for readability with markdown structure.

Solution: Formatting system that:
1. Counts tokens using character-based estimation (accurate within 10%)
2. Formats individual memories with metadata and structure
3. Formats memory blocks with budget awareness
4. Truncates memories when budget exceeded (prioritizes high-relevance)
5. Adds markdown headers and structure for readability

Key Features:

1. Token Counting:
   - Character-based estimation: tokens approx equals character_count / 4
   - Fast estimation (no external models needed)
   - Accurate within 5-10% for typical text
   - Handles edge cases (empty strings, unicode)

2. Memory Block Formatting:
   - Markdown format with metadata header
   - Relevance score displayed prominently
   - Timestamp for temporal context
   - Content with proper line breaks
   - Example: Relevance: 0.85 | 2026-01-02 with content

3. Budget-Aware Formatting:
   - Respects max_tokens constraint
   - Prioritizes high-relevance memories when budget constrained
   - Graceful truncation (shows ... if truncated)
   - Returns formatted markdown block with headers

4. Token Budgeting:
   - Default budget: 500 tokens
   - Configurable per call
   - Includes header/footer tokens in budget calculation
   - Reports actual tokens used

Public API:

Key functions:
- count_tokens(text: str) - Estimate tokens in text
- format_memory_block(memory: Dict) - Format single memory for display
- format_memories_with_budget(memories: List, max_tokens: int) - Format all memories within token budget

Constants:

- TOKENS_PER_CHAR = 4 - Assumed characters per token
- HEADER_TOKENS = 20 - Overhead for markdown headers
- DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS = 500 - Default budget
- TRUNCATION_MARKER = ... - Indicator of truncated content

Integration Points:

1. Memory Injection: Used by auto_inject_memory.py to format memories
2. Relevance Scoring: Takes output from memory_relevance.py (ranked memories)
3. SessionStart Hook: Formats memories before prompt injection

Test Coverage (28 tests):

Unit Tests:
- count_tokens() with various text lengths, unicode, special chars
- format_memory_block() with all metadata fields, missing fields
- format_memories_with_budget() with budget limits, priority sorting
- Truncation behavior at budget limits
- Edge cases: Empty memories, zero budget, single memory
- Performance benchmarks for formatting speed

Version History:
- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with token-aware formatting (Issue #192)

## 90. auto_inject_memory.py (9,089 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #192)

Purpose: Auto-inject relevant memories at SessionStart enabling cross-session context continuity for architectural decisions, blockers, and patterns.

Problem: Agents have no memory between sessions. Architectural decisions, blockers, and patterns must be re-explained. Manual context recovery is slow and error-prone. SessionStart lacks mechanism to inject persistent context.

Solution: SessionStart hook that:
1. Loads memories from .claude/memories/session_memories.json
2. Ranks memories by relevance to current task (TF-IDF)
3. Formats memories within token budget (default: 500)
4. Injects formatted memories into initial prompt as markdown context
5. Environment variable control (MEMORY_INJECTION_ENABLED, default false)

Key Features:

1. Memory Loading:
   - Loads from .claude/memories/session_memories.json
   - Graceful degradation if file missing (logs info, continues)
   - Validates JSON structure before processing
   - Handles corrupted memory files safely

2. Relevance Ranking:
   - Uses TF-IDF scoring to rank memories by relevance
   - Recency boost favors recent memories (1-30 days)
   - Threshold filtering (default: 0.7) removes low-relevance memories
   - Configurable via MEMORY_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD env var

3. Token Budget Enforcement:
   - Default budget: 500 tokens
   - Configurable via MEMORY_INJECTION_TOKEN_BUDGET env var
   - Prioritizes high-relevance memories when budget constrained
   - Graceful truncation if over budget

4. Prompt Injection:
   - Injects formatted memories into prompt as markdown block
   - Placed at top of prompt for visibility
   - Includes Relevant Context from Previous Sessions header
   - Clean markdown formatting with relevance scores

5. Environment Variable Control:
   - MEMORY_INJECTION_ENABLED (default: false) - Enable/disable injection
   - MEMORY_INJECTION_TOKEN_BUDGET (default: 500) - Max tokens for memories
   - MEMORY_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD (default: 0.7) - Min relevance score

Public API:

Key functions:
- inject_memories_into_prompt(original_prompt: str, project_root: Path, max_tokens: int) - Inject memories into prompt
- should_inject_memories() - Check if injection enabled
- load_relevant_memories(query: str, project_root: Path, threshold: float) - Load and rank relevant memories

Integration Points:

1. SessionStart Hook: Triggered automatically when new session/conversation starts
2. Memory Layer: Reads memories from memory_layer.py storage
3. Relevance Scoring: Uses memory_relevance.py for ranking
4. Formatting: Uses memory_formatter.py for token-aware formatting
5. Prompt Modification: Modifies initial prompt before agent sees it

Configuration:

Environment variables (set in .env or shell):
- MEMORY_INJECTION_ENABLED=true - Enable memory injection (default: false)
- MEMORY_INJECTION_TOKEN_BUDGET=1000 - Max tokens (default: 500)
- MEMORY_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.5 - Min score (default: 0.7)

Test Coverage (36 tests):

Unit Tests:
- inject_memories_into_prompt() with various scenarios
- should_inject_memories() with env var states
- load_relevant_memories() with query matching
- Prompt injection formatting
- Memory file loading and validation
- Edge cases: Missing files, corrupted JSON, empty memories
- Performance benchmarks for injection speed

Version History:
- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release with SessionStart memory injection (Issue #192)

Dependencies:
- memory_layer.py - Memory persistence
- memory_relevance.py - Relevance scoring

## 91. feature_flags.py (230 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #193)

**Purpose**: Configuration management for optional features with graceful degradation enabling selective feature control without code changes.

**Problem**: Features like conflict_resolver and auto_git_workflow should be configurable. Users need ability to opt-out of features without modifying code. Configuration should have sensible defaults and graceful failure modes.

**Solution**: Feature flag system that:
1. Loads configuration from .claude/feature_flags.json (optional)
2. Defaults all features to ENABLED (opt-out model)
3. Provides graceful degradation for missing/invalid configs
4. Prevents path traversal attacks via validate_path()
5. Has built-in defaults for all known features

**Key Features**:

1. Feature Flag Loading:
   - Loads from .claude/feature_flags.json
   - Opt-out model (all features enabled by default)
   - Missing file returns empty dict (all features enabled)
   - Invalid JSON returns empty dict (graceful degradation)

2. Default Behaviors:
   - conflict_resolver: enabled=true, confidence_threshold=0.8, security_requires_manual=true
   - auto_git_workflow: enabled=true, auto_push=false, auto_pr=false

3. Security:
   - Path validation via validate_path() (CWE-22)
   - No arbitrary code execution
   - JSON parsing with error handling
   - Graceful fallback on errors

4. Configuration File Format:
   - Location: .claude/feature_flags.json
   - Format: JSON with feature names as keys
   - Structure: {"feature_name": {"enabled": true, "key": "value"}}

**Public API**:

Key functions:
- is_feature_enabled(feature_name: str) -> bool - Check if feature is enabled
- get_feature_config(feature_name: str) -> Dict - Get complete feature configuration
- get_default_flags() -> Dict - Get all default flags
- _load_feature_flags() -> Dict - Load flags from configuration file (internal)
- _get_feature_flags_path() -> Optional[Path] - Get path to flags file (internal)
- _find_project_root() -> Optional[Path] - Find project root (internal)

**Configuration**:

Feature Flags File (.claude/feature_flags.json):
```json
{
  "conflict_resolver": {
    "enabled": true,
    "confidence_threshold": 0.8,
    "security_requires_manual": true
  },
  "auto_git_workflow": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto_push": false,
    "auto_pr": false
  }
}
```

Default Behavior:
- Missing file = all features enabled
- Missing feature = enabled
- Invalid JSON = all features enabled
- Read errors = all features enabled

**Integration Points**:

1. Conflict Resolver: worktree_conflict_integration.py checks conflict_resolver flag
2. Git Automation: auto_git_workflow hook checks auto_git_workflow flag
3. Worktree Manager: merge_worktree() honors conflict_resolver configuration
4. Feature Control: Any system can check is_feature_enabled() before executing

**Test Coverage**:

Unit Tests:
- is_feature_enabled() with file present/missing/corrupted
- get_feature_config() with various configurations
- Default flag loading
- Path validation (CWE-22 prevention)
- Graceful degradation for missing/invalid files
- Edge cases: Empty flags, wrong JSON structure

**Version History**:
- v1.0.0 (2026-01-02) - Initial release for conflict resolver integration (Issue #193)

**Dependencies**:
- security_utils.py - Path validation
- Standard library: json, pathlib, typing

## 92. worktree_conflict_integration.py (387 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #193)

**Purpose**: Glue layer integrating AI-powered conflict resolution into worktree workflow with security detection and confidence thresholds enabling automatic merge conflict handling.

**Problem**: /worktree --merge conflicts are 100% manual. Users must edit files, understand conflict markers, resolve manually. This blocks automated workflows and requires human intervention. No way to automatically suggest resolutions or enforce security reviews.

**Solution**: Integration system that:
1. Detects merge conflicts from git output
2. Triggers AI resolution via conflict_resolver.py
3. Enforces confidence thresholds (0.8 default)
4. Requires manual review for security files
5. Provides three-tier escalation strategy
6. Integrates with worktree_manager.merge_worktree()

**Key Features**:

1. Conflict Detection:
   - Parses git merge output for conflict markers
   - Detects files with <<<<<<< or ======= or >>>>>>>
   - Returns list of conflicted file paths

2. Security Detection:
   - Detects security-related files by pattern
   - Patterns: security_*.py, credentials.py, secrets.py, *.key, *.pem, *.crt
   - Path patterns: /security/, /credentials/, /secrets/
   - Forces manual review regardless of confidence

3. Confidence Thresholds:
   - AUTO_COMMIT_THRESHOLD = 0.8 (80%)
   - High confidence (>=0.8) + not security = auto-commit
   - Medium confidence (0.6-0.8) = suggest but manual review
   - Low confidence (<0.6) = fallback to manual
   - Security files always require manual review

4. Three-Tier Escalation:
   - Tier 1: Auto-resolve and auto-commit (high confidence, not security)
   - Tier 2: Suggest resolution, require manual approval (medium confidence or security file)
   - Tier 3: Fallback to manual merge (low confidence or AI error)

5. Feature Flag Integration:
   - Checks conflict_resolver feature flag
   - Returns empty results if feature disabled
   - Graceful degradation if API key missing

**Public API**:

Key functions:
- resolve_worktree_conflicts(conflict_files: List[str], api_key: Optional[str]) -> List[ConflictResolutionResult] - Resolve multiple files
- should_auto_commit(result: ConflictResolutionResult) -> bool - Check if should auto-commit
- get_resolution_confidence(result: ConflictResolutionResult) -> float - Extract confidence score
- detect_conflicts_in_output(git_output: str) -> List[str] - Parse git output for conflicts
- has_conflict_markers(file_path: str) -> bool - Check if file has conflict markers
- is_security_related(file_path: str) -> bool - Detect security files

**Configuration**:

Feature Flags:
- conflict_resolver feature flag (must be enabled)

Environment Variables:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY - Required for AI resolution

Constants:
- AUTO_COMMIT_THRESHOLD = 0.8 - Confidence threshold for auto-commit

**Security**:

1. Path Validation:
   - All file paths validated via validate_path() (CWE-22)
   - Rejects relative paths with ..
   - Rejects symlinks

2. Security File Detection:
   - Strict pattern matching (avoids false positives)
   - Requires manual review for security files
   - Always requires manual review regardless of confidence

3. API Key Handling:
   - Read from environment only (never logged)
   - Graceful failure if missing
   - Returns empty results if missing

4. Audit Logging:
   - All resolutions logged via audit_log()
   - All errors logged with context
   - Non-sensitive information only

5. Error Handling:
   - Path validation errors handled gracefully
   - Missing API key returns empty results
   - Resolution failures fallback to manual
   - Missing dependencies handled safely

**Integration Points**:

1. Worktree Manager: Called by merge_worktree(auto_resolve=True)
2. Conflict Resolver: Calls resolve_conflicts() for each file
3. Feature Flags: Checks is_feature_enabled('conflict_resolver')
4. Git Automation: Results feed into auto-commit decision

**Test Coverage**:

Unit Tests:
- is_security_related() with various patterns

## 67. research_persistence.py (901 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #196, enhanced Issue #628)

**Purpose**: Auto-save research findings to docs/research/ with frontmatter metadata and caching, enabling research reuse across sessions and features without duplication.

**Problem**: Research findings are lost when conversation clears with /clear. No caching mechanism for repeated research topics. No centralized research knowledge base. Manual research duplication across features wastes time and introduces inconsistency.

**Solution**: Create research_persistence.py library providing save/load functions, age-based cache checking, and automatic index generation for research catalog.

**Key Features**:

1. **Research Saving** (save_research):
   - Saves to docs/research/TOPIC_NAME.md (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming)
   - YAML frontmatter: topic, created, updated, sources
   - Markdown content: findings plus automatically generated source links
   - Atomic write pattern (temp file plus replace) for safe concurrent access
   - Preserves created timestamp on updates

2. **Cache Checking** (check_cache):
   - Returns path if recent research exists
   - Age-based checking: max_age_days parameter (default: 30 days)
   - Fast path: file existence plus stat check (O(1))

3. **Research Loading** (load_cached_research):
   - Loads file and parses YAML frontmatter
   - Returns dict with: topic, created, updated, sources, content
   - Handles malformed files gracefully (returns None)

4. **Index Generation** (update_index):
   - Scans all .md files in docs/research/ (except README.md)
   - Generates README.md with research catalog table
   - Columns: Topic, Created, Sources, File

5. **Topic to Filename** (topic_to_filename):
   - Converts JWT Authentication to JWT_AUTHENTICATION.md
   - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE naming
   - Sanitizes special characters and truncates to filesystem limits

6. **Issue Research Detection** (detect_issue_research):
   - Scans a GitHub issue body for H2 headings that indicate pre-researched content from /create-issue
   - Recognises sections: "Implementation Approach", "What Does NOT Work", "Security Considerations", "Test Scenarios", "Architecture", "Research Findings", "Technical Details", "Existing Patterns", "Edge Cases", "Background", "Context", "Dependencies", "Scenarios"
   - Returns is_research_rich (True when section_count >= 3), matched_sections, section_count, and issue_body_as_research (concatenated content)
   - Used by /implement STEP 3 to skip redundant STEP 4 research when the issue already contains sufficient context

**Public API**:

Key functions:
- save_research(topic: str, findings: str, sources: List[str]) -> Path
- check_cache(topic: str, max_age_days: int = 30) -> Optional[Path]
- load_cached_research(topic: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
- update_index() -> Path
- topic_to_filename(topic: str) -> str
- detect_issue_research(issue_body: str) -> Dict[str, Any]

Custom Exception:
- ResearchPersistenceError - Raised on validation/IO errors

**Security Features**:

1. **Atomic Write Pattern**: Temp file plus atomic rename for safe concurrent access
2. **Path Traversal Prevention (CWE-22)**: Sanitized filenames, validated paths
3. **Symlink Rejection (CWE-59)**: Via validate_session_path()
4. **Input Validation**: Topic, findings, sources validation
5. **Error Handling**: Disk full (ENOSPC), permission errors handled gracefully

**Integration with Path Utils**:

- Uses get_research_dir() from path_utils.py (NEW in Issue #196)
- Portable path detection (works from any directory)
- Creates docs/research/ with safe permissions (0o755)

**Configuration**:

Constants:
- Cache age: max_age_days parameter (default: 30 days)
- Filename truncation: 252 chars max (255 - 3 for .md)
- Permissions: 0o644 for research files, 0o755 for directories

**Dependencies**:

Standard Library:
- os - temp file creation, write operations
- re - topic sanitization regex
- tempfile - atomic write pattern
- datetime - timestamp generation
- pathlib - path operations
- typing - type hints

Project Dependencies:
- path_utils.py - get_research_dir() function
- validation.py - validate_session_path() function

**Usage Examples**:

Save research with metadata and sources:
```
from research_persistence import save_research
path = save_research(
    topic=JWT Authentication,
    findings=## Key Findings: 1. JWT is stateless,
    sources=[https://jwt.io]
)
```

Check cache before researching:
```
from research_persistence import check_cache
cached_path = check_cache(JWT Authentication, max_age_days=30)
if cached_path:
    print(Cache hit, use existing research)
```

Load cached research:
```
from research_persistence import load_cached_research
data = load_cached_research(JWT Authentication)
if data:
    print(data[content])
```

Update research catalog:
```
from research_persistence import update_index
readme_path = update_index()
```

**Test Coverage**:

Unit Tests (50+ test cases):
- topic_to_filename conversion (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
- save_research function (file creation, frontmatter, atomic writes)
- check_cache function (age-based checking)
- load_cached_research function (parsing, error handling)
- update_index function (catalog generation)
- Frontmatter parsing (YAML validation)
- Security validation (CWE-22, CWE-59)
- Error handling (disk full, permissions, corruption)

Integration Tests:
- Save and load round-trip
- Multiple research files with index generation
- Cache hit/miss with age boundaries
- Cross-project portability

**Performance**:

Time Complexity:
- save_research(): O(n) where n = findings size
- check_cache(): O(1) file existence check
- load_cached_research(): O(n) where n = file size
- update_index(): O(m) where m = number of .md files

Typical Performance:
- save_research: less than 50ms for typical research
- check_cache: less than 5ms (file stat check)
- load_cached_research: less than 20ms for typical file
- update_index: less than 100ms for 50 research files

## 93. comprehensive_doc_validator.py (708 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #198)

**Purpose**: Validate cross-references between documentation files to prevent documentation drift and ensure accuracy.

**Problem**: Documentation gets out of sync with code during development. Commands listed in README may not exist in code. Features listed in PROJECT.md may not be implemented. Code examples may have wrong API signatures. No systematic validation catches drift until manual reviews, causing user confusion.

**Solution**: Comprehensive documentation validator with four validation categories (command exports, project features, code examples, counts) plus auto-fix engine for safe patterns. Integrates into /implement pipeline via doc-master agent.

**Key APIs**:

**DataClasses**:
- ValidationIssue: Represents single validation issue
  - category: str - Issue category (command, feature, example, count)
  - severity: str - Issue severity (error, warning, info)
  - message: str - Human-readable description
  - file_path: str - Path to file with issue
  - line_number: int - Line number (0 if unknown)
  - auto_fixable: bool - Whether issue can be auto-fixed safely
  - suggested_fix: str - Suggested fix description

- ValidationReport: Comprehensive validation report
  - issues: List[ValidationIssue] - All issues found
  - has_issues: bool (property) - Whether any issues found
  - has_auto_fixable: bool (property) - Whether any can be auto-fixed
  - has_manual_review: bool (property) - Whether any require manual review
  - auto_fixable_issues: List[ValidationIssue] (property) - Filtered auto-fixable list
  - manual_review_issues: List[ValidationIssue] (property) - Filtered manual review list

**Main Class**:
- ComprehensiveDocValidator:
  - __init__(repo_root: Path, batch_mode: bool = False) - Initialize validator
  - validate_all() -> ValidationReport - Run all validation checks
  - validate_command_exports() -> List[ValidationIssue] - Validate README vs commands/
  - validate_project_features() -> List[ValidationIssue] - Validate PROJECT.md SCOPE vs code
  - validate_code_examples() -> List[ValidationIssue] - Validate API signatures in docs
  - auto_fix_safe_patterns(issues: List[ValidationIssue]) -> int - Auto-fix safe patterns

**Validation Categories**:

1. **Command Export Validation** (validate_command_exports):
   - Scans plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/ for all command files
   - Extracts command names from filenames and docstrings
   - Checks each command has entry in plugins/autonomous-dev/README.md
   - Detects missing command entries (error severity)
   - Detects orphaned command files with no README entries (warning severity)
   - Auto-fix: Generates markdown snippet for missing entries

2. **Project Feature Validation** (validate_project_features):
   - Parses PROJECT.md SCOPE (In Scope) section
   - Extracts implemented features from code files and agents
   - Detects features in PROJECT.md but not implemented (warning severity)
   - Detects implemented features not in PROJECT.md (error severity)
   - Auto-fix: Adds missing features to PROJECT.md SCOPE with descriptions

3. **Code Example Validation** (validate_code_examples):
   - Extracts docstring examples from agent and skill files
   - Parses function signatures from actual code
   - Validates example signatures match implementation
   - Reports line numbers for manual review (warning severity, not auto-fixable)
   - Handles parse errors gracefully (reports as issues, doesn't crash)

4. **Count Validation** (implicit in validate_project_features):
   - Validates agent counts in CLAUDE.md (Agents: X)
   - Validates command counts (Commands: X)
   - Validates skill counts (Skills: X)
   - Detects count mismatches with actual implementation
   - Auto-fix: Updates numbers to match actual counts

**Auto-Fix Engine** (auto_fix_safe_patterns):
- Safely patches documentation with suggested fixes
- Only fixes safe patterns:
  - Missing command entries (appends to README)
  - Count mismatches (updates numbers in-place)
  - Not auto-fixed: feature descriptions, example signatures, complex logic
- Non-blocking: Never raises exceptions
- Logs all fixes to audit trail
- Returns count of successfully fixed issues

**Integration Points**:

- /implement pipeline: Runs after doc-master agent completes
- doc-master agent: Calls ComprehensiveDocValidator before finalizing docs
- /sync command: Includes validation in sync workflow
- PreCommit hook: Optional validation gate before commit (VALIDATE_COMPREHENSIVE_DOCS=true)

**Configuration**:

Environment Variables:
- VALIDATE_COMPREHENSIVE_DOCS: Enable/disable validation (default: false)
  - Set to true in batch mode to enable validation
  - Set to false to disable validation checks

**Security Features**:

  - Validates all file paths before opening
  - Prevents path traversal attacks
  - Rejects symlinks via validate_path()
- Non-blocking design: Never raises exceptions
  - Logs issues safely
  - Continues validation on errors
  - Graceful error handling for corrupted files
- Input sanitization
  - Topic validation
  - Filename sanitization
  - Content encoding checks
- Audit logging
  - Logs all validation operations
  - Records fixes applied
  - Timestamps all events

**Performance**:

Time Complexity:
- validate_command_exports(): O(m) where m = number of command files
- validate_project_features(): O(n) where n = number of code files
- validate_code_examples(): O(n*k) where n = files, k = avg examples per file
- auto_fix_safe_patterns(): O(p) where p = issues to fix

Typical Performance:
- Small project (10 commands, 50 code files): 100-200ms total
- Medium project (50 commands, 500 code files): 500-1000ms total
- Large project (100+ commands): 1-3 seconds total

Scales linearly with codebase size.

**Files Added**:
- plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/comprehensive_doc_validator.py (708 lines)
- tests/unit/lib/test_comprehensive_doc_validator.py (1082 lines)

## 94. test_runner.py (396 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #200)

**Purpose**: Autonomous test execution with structured results for debug-first enforcement.

**Problem**: Test execution during autonomous development requires structured results (pass/fail counts, duration) rather than just exit codes. Developers need quick verification without manual parsing.

**Solution**: test_runner library that executes pytest and returns TestResult dataclass with pass/fail counts, output, and duration.

### Features

## 96. doc_update_risk_classifier.py (168 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #204)

**Purpose**: Risk classification for documentation updates to support auto-apply workflow in doc-master agent.

**Problem**: Documentation updates should be auto-applied when they're safe (low-risk) but require user approval when they're strategic changes (high-risk). The doc-master agent needs to classify updates and make intelligent decisions about application.

**Solution**: doc_update_risk_classifier library that classifies documentation changes as LOW_RISK (auto-apply) or HIGH_RISK (requires approval).

### Features

- Classify documentation files by risk level
- LOW_RISK files: CHANGELOG.md, README.md, and PROJECT.md metadata
- HIGH_RISK sections: PROJECT.md GOALS, CONSTRAINTS, SCOPE, ARCHITECTURE
- Confidence scoring for classification (0.0 to 1.0)
- Pattern-based metadata detection (timestamps, component counts, compliance dates)
- Conservative defaults (unknown files classified as HIGH_RISK)

### API Classes

#### RiskLevel

Enumeration of risk levels:
- LOW_RISK: "low_risk" - Auto-apply without prompt
- HIGH_RISK: "high_risk" - Requires user approval

#### RiskClassification

Named tuple with classification result:
- risk_level: RiskLevel - Classified risk level
- confidence: float - Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
- reason: str - Human-readable reason for classification
- requires_approval: bool - Whether user approval is required

#### DocUpdateRiskClassifier

Stateless risk classifier for documentation updates.

Class attributes:
- LOW_RISK_FILES: Set[str] = {"CHANGELOG.md", "README.md"}
- HIGH_RISK_SECTIONS: Set[str] = {"GOALS", "CONSTRAINTS", "SCOPE", "ARCHITECTURE"}
- LOW_RISK_PATTERNS: List[str] - Regex patterns for metadata detection

Class methods:
- classify(file_path: str, changes: List[str]) -> RiskClassification - Classify a documentation update
- _classify_project_md(changes: List[str]) -> RiskClassification - Specialized PROJECT.md classification

### Functions

Convenience function to classify a documentation update.

Signature: classify_doc_update(file_path: str, changes: List[str]) -> RiskClassification

Parameters:
- file_path: str - Path to the documentation file
- changes: List[str] - List of changed lines or content

Returns: RiskClassification with risk level, confidence, and reason

### Classification Rules

1. CHANGELOG.md: Always LOW_RISK (confidence 0.95)
2. README.md: Always LOW_RISK (confidence 0.95)
3. PROJECT.md with GOALS/CONSTRAINTS/SCOPE/ARCHITECTURE headers: HIGH_RISK (confidence 0.9)
4. PROJECT.md with metadata patterns (timestamps, counts): LOW_RISK (confidence 0.7-0.95)
5. PROJECT.md other content: HIGH_RISK conservative default (confidence 0.6)
6. Unknown files: HIGH_RISK conservative default (confidence 0.5)
7. Empty/None inputs: LOW_RISK with low confidence (0.3) for known files

### Metadata Patterns

Patterns matched for LOW_RISK classification in PROJECT.md:
- **Last Updated**: timestamp
- **Last Compliance Check**: timestamp
- **Last Validated**: timestamp
- Component version table rows (Skills, Commands, Agents, Hooks, Settings)

**Performance**: O(n) where n = number of changes (regex pattern matching)

**Dependencies**: enum, typing, pathlib, re - Standard library

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-01-09) - Initial release for doc-master auto-apply (Issue #204)

---

## 97. doc_master_auto_apply.py (249 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #204)

**Purpose**: Auto-apply documentation updates with intelligent approval workflow for doc-master agent.

**Problem**: The doc-master agent updates documentation but needs different handling for safe vs strategic changes. Interactive prompts for every change disrupt autonomous workflows; batch mode must skip high-risk changes.

**Solution**: doc_master_auto_apply library that applies LOW_RISK updates automatically and prompts for HIGH_RISK updates in interactive mode (or skips in batch mode).

Parameters:
- updates: List of DocUpdate objects to apply
- batch_mode: If True, skip HIGH_RISK updates (default: True)

Returns: List of DocUpdateResult for each update

### Workflow

1. **Classify**: Risk classifier determines risk level and confidence
2. **LOW_RISK**: Write immediately, return success
3. **HIGH_RISK in batch mode**: Log and skip, return skipped status
4. **HIGH_RISK in interactive mode**: Display warning, prompt user, apply if approved
5. **File system**: Create parent directories, write content, handle errors

### Error Handling

- File write failures: Returns DocUpdateResult with error details
- Invalid inputs: Returns error result with message
- Missing file paths: Creates parent directories automatically
- Permission errors: Returns error result

**Dependencies**: logging, typing, pathlib, datetime, re - Standard library

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-01-09) - Initial release for progress tracker integration (Issue #204)

## 99. alignment_gate.py (642 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #251)

**Purpose**: Strict PROJECT.md alignment validation using GenAI with score-based gating for feature proposals.

**Problem**: When proposing new features, it's unclear if they align with PROJECT.md goals and scope. Features that don't explicitly match SCOPE items are approved anyway, leading to scope creep. No systematic way to validate alignment with constraints.

**Solution**: Alignment gate library that validates features against PROJECT.md using GenAI. Features must:
1. Score >= 7 on alignment (0-10 scale)
2. EXPLICITLY match a SCOPE item (not just "related to")
3. Not violate CONSTRAINTS
4. Pass strict gatekeeper validation (rejects ambiguous features)

### Features

- GenAI-powered strict alignment validation
- Score-based gating (7+ threshold for approval)
- Explicit SCOPE membership requirement (not "related to")
- Constraint violation detection (blocks even high-scoring features)
- Decision tracking to alignment_history.jsonl (JSONL format)
- Meta-validation statistics (approval rate, average score, constraint violations)
- Support for both Anthropic and OpenRouter APIs
- Comprehensive error messages with actionable suggestions
- Audit logging for all validation decisions

### API Classes

#### AlignmentGateResult

Result of strict alignment validation with complete analysis.

**Attributes**:
- `aligned: bool` - Whether feature aligns with PROJECT.md (score >= 7, no constraints)
- `score: int` - Alignment score 0-10 (7+ = pass, <7 = fail)
- `violations: List[str]` - List of SCOPE/GOAL violations
- `reasoning: str` - Detailed reasoning for alignment decision
- `relevant_scope: List[str]` - List of SCOPE items that match
- `suggestions: List[str]` - Suggestions for improving alignment
- `constraint_violations: List[str]` - List of CONSTRAINT violations (blocks approval)
- `confidence: str` - Confidence level (high/medium/low)

**Methods**:
- `to_dict() -> Dict[str, Any]` - Convert to dictionary for JSON serialization

### Functions

#### validate_alignment_strict()

Strict alignment validation using GenAI. This is a STRICT GATEKEEPER that:
- Requires EXPLICIT SCOPE match (not "related to")
- Scores ambiguous features 4-6 (not 7+)
- Blocks constraint violations even if score is high
- Requires score >= 7 to pass

Signature: validate_alignment_strict(
    feature_desc: str,
    project_md_path: Optional[Path] = None
) -> AlignmentGateResult

Parameters:
- `feature_desc: str` - Feature description to validate
- `project_md_path: Optional[Path]` - Path to PROJECT.md (default: .claude/PROJECT.md)

Returns: `AlignmentGateResult` with validation decision

Raises: `AlignmentError` if feature description is empty/invalid or PROJECT.md issues

Example:
```python
from alignment_gate import validate_alignment_strict

result = validate_alignment_strict("Add CLI command for git status")
if result.aligned and result.score >= 7:
    print("Feature approved!")
else:
    print(f"Feature blocked: {result.reasoning}")
    for violation in result.violations:
        print(f"  - {violation}")
```

#### check_scope_membership()

Check if feature EXPLICITLY matches an IN SCOPE item (strict matching).

Signature: check_scope_membership(feature: str, scope_section: str) -> bool

Parameters:
- `feature: str` - Feature description
- `scope_section: str` - SCOPE section content from PROJECT.md

Returns: `True` if explicit match found, `False` otherwise

Logic:
- Extract scope items from PROJECT.md SCOPE section
- Remove common stopwords (the, a, and, for, etc.)
- Normalize plural forms (s suffix)
- Require at least 50% of significant words to match
- For compound terms, require > 1 match to avoid false positives

Example:
```python
from alignment_gate import check_scope_membership

scope = "- CLI commands\n- Git automation\n- Testing framework"
result = check_scope_membership("Add CLI command", scope)
# Returns: True (matches "CLI commands")
```

#### track_alignment_decision()

Track alignment decision to history file (JSONL format).

Signature: track_alignment_decision(result: AlignmentGateResult) -> None

Appends decision record to logs/alignment_history.jsonl with timestamp:
```json
{"aligned": true, "score": 8, "violations": [], ..., "timestamp": "2026-01-19T15:30:00Z"}
```

#### get_alignment_stats()

Get meta-validation statistics from alignment history.

Signature: get_alignment_stats() -> Dict[str, Any]

Returns dict with keys:
- `total_decisions: int` - Total number of alignment decisions
- `approved_count: int` - Number of approved features
- `rejected_count: int` - Number of rejected features
- `approval_rate: float` - Percentage of approved features (0.0-1.0)
- `average_score: float` - Average alignment score
- `constraint_violation_count: int` - Number of decisions with constraint violations

Example:
```python
from alignment_gate import get_alignment_stats

stats = get_alignment_stats()
print(f"Approval rate: {stats['approval_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Average score: {stats['average_score']:.1f}")
```

### GenAI Integration

#### LLM Client Selection

Automatically selects LLM provider (priority order):
1. Anthropic API (if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set) - Uses claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
2. OpenRouter API (if OPENROUTER_API_KEY set) - Uses anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5

Raises `AlignmentError` if no API key found.

#### Prompt Strategy

STRICT GATEKEEPER prompt that:
- Provides PROJECT.md context (GOALS, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS, CURRENT_SPRINT)
- Enforces explicit SCOPE membership requirement
- Assigns ambiguous features scores 4-6
- Blocks constraint violations regardless of score
- Defines clear scoring scale:
  - 9-10: Perfect explicit match, no violations
  - 7-8: Good explicit match, minor concerns
  - 4-6: Ambiguous, needs clarification, or tangentially related
  - 1-3: Clearly out of scope, not aligned with GOALS
  - 0: Completely unrelated or harmful

### Scoring Rules

**Perfect Match (9-10)**:
- Explicitly matches SCOPE item
- Aligns with GOALS
- No constraint violations
- Clear, detailed description

**Good Match (7-8)**:
- Good explicit match to SCOPE
- Aligns with GOALS
- No major constraint violations
- Minor concerns addressed

**Ambiguous (4-6)**:
- Vague descriptions ("improve performance")
- One-word descriptions
- Missing context or metrics
- Only tangentially related to SCOPE
- Needs clarification

**Out of Scope (1-3)**:
- Clearly doesn't match SCOPE
- Not aligned with GOALS
- Missing implementation details

**Harmful (0)**:
- Completely unrelated
- Contradicts GOALS
- Major constraint violations

### Decision Tracking

Decisions tracked to `logs/alignment_history.jsonl` (JSONL format):
- One JSON record per line
- ISO 8601 timestamps (UTC)
- Complete decision data: score, violations, reasoning, suggestions
- JSONL format allows easy querying and statistical analysis

### PROJECT.md Integration

**Required Sections**:
- `## GOALS` - Project success criteria and objectives
- `## SCOPE` - In-scope and out-of-scope features
- `## CONSTRAINTS` - Technical, resource, and philosophical limits
- `## CURRENT_SPRINT` - Active focus (optional)

**Validation Errors**:
- Missing PROJECT.md: Raises error with helpful path hints
- Missing GOALS/SCOPE sections: Raises error listing found sections
- Malformed content: Raises error with expected format

### Error Handling

- Empty/invalid feature descriptions: Raises `AlignmentError`
- PROJECT.md not found: Raises `AlignmentError` with path hints
- API key missing: Raises `AlignmentError` with setup instructions
- GenAI response parsing: Raises `AlignmentError` with response snippet
- Malformed JSON response: Raises `AlignmentError` with details

### Performance

- GenAI API call: 1-3 seconds (network dependent)
- SCOPE membership check: O(n) where n = number of SCOPE items
- History statistics: O(m) where m = number of tracked decisions
- Total validation: 1-3 seconds per feature

### Security

- Input sanitization for GenAI prompts (no prompt injection)
- JSON output validation and error handling
- Audit logging for all decisions via security_utils
- File path validation via pathlib (CWE-22 prevention)
- Project root detection with fallback handling

### Integration Points

**Feature Proposal Workflow**:
1. User proposes new feature
2. Feature description validated via validate_alignment_strict()
3. GenAI scores feature against PROJECT.md
4. Decision tracked to alignment_history.jsonl
5. Result shown to user (approved/rejected with reasoning)

**Analysis Tools**:
- Use `get_alignment_stats()` to monitor approval trends
- Query `logs/alignment_history.jsonl` directly for detailed analysis
- Track constraint violations separately from low-score rejections

### Constants

- `ALIGNMENT_SCORE_THRESHOLD = 7` - Score required for approval
- `PROJECT_ROOT` - Dynamically detected from .git or .claude
- `ALIGNMENT_HISTORY_PATH` - logs/alignment_history.jsonl (relative to PROJECT_ROOT)

### Module Exports

```python
__all__ = [
    "AlignmentGateResult",

**Purpose**: Harness effectiveness benchmark for the reviewer agent. Loads labeled datasets of real diffs with ground-truth verdicts, constructs reviewer prompts, parses model verdicts, and computes scoring metrics.

**Problem**: No objective way to measure whether the reviewer agent correctly identifies defective code vs. clean code, or whether its verdicts are consistent across repeated invocations.

**Solution**: A standalone benchmark library that drives the reviewer against labeled diff samples and reports balanced accuracy, false positive rate, false negative rate, inter-trial consistency, and per-difficulty/per-defect-category breakdowns.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/reviewer_benchmark.py`

**Key Concepts**:
- Binary classification: BLOCKING/REQUEST_CHANGES = positive (defective), APPROVE = negative (clean)
- Balanced accuracy = (TPR + TNR) / 2 — accounts for class imbalance
- Consistency rate = average fraction of trials matching majority verdict across samples
- PARSE_ERROR results are excluded from accuracy calculations but counted in consistency
- Difficulty stratification: easy/medium/hard tiers with per-tier accuracy breakdowns
- Defect taxonomy: 91-category taxonomy with per-category accuracy breakdowns

**Data Structures**:

```python
@dataclass
class BenchmarkSample:
    sample_id: str
    source_repo: str
    issue_ref: str
    diff_text: str
    expected_verdict: str          # APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | BLOCKING
    expected_categories: List[str]
    category_tags: List[str]
    description: str
    difficulty: str = "medium"     # easy | medium | hard
    commit_sha: str = ""           # git commit SHA for provenance
    defect_category: str = ""      # primary category from taxonomy

@dataclass
class BenchmarkResult:
    sample_id: str
    predicted_verdict: str
    expected_verdict: str
    findings: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    raw_response: str
    trial_index: int

@dataclass
class ScoringReport:
    balanced_accuracy: float
    false_positive_rate: float
    false_negative_rate: float
    per_category: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]
    confusion_matrix: Dict[str, int]   # keys: TP, TN, FP, FN
    total_samples: int
    trials_per_sample: int
    consistency_rate: float
    per_difficulty: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]      # accuracy by easy/medium/hard
    per_defect_category: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] # accuracy by taxonomy category
    timestamp: str
```

**Public API**:
- `load_dataset(path: Path) -> List[BenchmarkSample]` — loads and validates a JSON dataset; raises `FileNotFoundError` or `ValueError` on invalid input
- `build_reviewer_prompt(sample, reviewer_instructions) -> str` — constructs full reviewer prompt from a sample
- `parse_verdict(response: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Dict]]` — extracts verdict and findings; looks for `## Verdict: VERDICT` heading first (case-insensitive), falls back to bare keyword search in last 200 characters (also case-insensitive, returns upper-cased result); returns `"PARSE_ERROR"` when no verdict found
- `score_results(results: List[BenchmarkResult], *, samples: Optional[List[BenchmarkSample]] = None) -> ScoringReport` — computes all metrics; pass `samples` to enable `per_difficulty` and `per_defect_category` breakdowns, and to change `per_category` grouping from `expected_verdict` keys to `category_tags` from the sample metadata (a single result contributes to every tag in its sample's `category_tags` list)
- `store_benchmark_run(store, report: ScoringReport) -> None` — persists report to a `BenchmarkStore` under key `"reviewer-effectiveness"`

**Dataset Format** (`tests/benchmarks/reviewer/dataset.json`):
```json
{
  "samples": [
    {
      "sample_id": "string",
      "source_repo": "string",
      "issue_ref": "#NNN",
      "diff_text": "unified diff...",
      "expected_verdict": "APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|BLOCKING",
      "expected_categories": ["category"],
      "category_tags": ["tag"],
      "description": "Human-readable description",
      "difficulty": "easy|medium|hard",
      "commit_sha": "optional git sha",
      "defect_category": "optional taxonomy category"
    }
  ]
}
```

**CLI Runner**: `scripts/run_reviewer_benchmark.py` — drives the full benchmark loop against an Anthropic model, collects results across trials, and saves the report. Supports `--filter-difficulty` (easy/medium/hard), `--filter-category` (taxonomy category name), and `--validate-dataset` (report stats without API calls).

**Mining Scripts** (Issue #573):
- `scripts/mine_git_samples.py` — scans fix commits and clean commits in a git repository to generate labeled diff sample candidates; uses `tests/benchmarks/reviewer/taxonomy.json` for defect classification
- `scripts/mine_session_logs.py` — parses Claude Code session activity JSONL logs to identify reviewer-related events and potential missed defects for benchmark expansion

**Dataset**: `tests/benchmarks/reviewer/dataset.json` — expanded from 14 to 146 labeled samples (Issue #573)

**Taxonomy**: `tests/benchmarks/reviewer/taxonomy.json` — 91 defect categories used for sample classification and `--filter-category` filtering (Issue #573)

**Testing**: `tests/unit/lib/test_reviewer_benchmark.py`, `tests/unit/scripts/test_mine_git_samples.py`, `tests/unit/scripts/test_mine_session_logs.py`, `tests/genai/test_acceptance_benchmark_expansion.py`

**Version History**:
- v1.1.1 (2026-03-29) - 4 bug fixes: invalid-JSON raises `ValueError` with path context; `--validate-dataset` no longer requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; bare verdict keyword matching is now case-insensitive; `per_category` groups by `category_tags` (not `expected_verdict`) when `samples` are supplied (Issue #568)
- v1.1.0 (2026-03-28) - Expanded to 146 samples, 91-category taxonomy, difficulty stratification, per-difficulty/per-defect-category scoring, mining scripts (Issue #573)
- v1.0.0 (2026-03-28) - Initial release for harness effectiveness benchmark suite (Issue #567)

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-01-19) - Initial release for strict PROJECT.md alignment validation (Issue #251)

## runtime_data_aggregator.py (v1.0.0 - Issue #579)

**Purpose**: Collect, normalize, rank, and persist improvement signals from session logs, benchmark history, CI bypass patterns, and GitHub issues to drive the automated reviewer improvement loop.

**Problem**: Improvement signals exist across 4 disparate sources (session activity logs, benchmark history, CI logs, GitHub issues). There was no unified way to collect, normalize severity, compute cross-source priority, or persist ranked reports for downstream consumers.

**Solution**: A single `aggregate()` entry point that collects from all sources in parallel, normalizes severity to [0,1], applies type-specific priority weights, ranks signals, caps at top_n, and appends to an append-only JSONL report log.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/runtime_data_aggregator.py`

**Security**:
- CWE-532: Secret scrubbing (API keys, tokens, passwords) via `scrub_secrets()`
- CWE-400: Line cap on session log reading (`MAX_LINES = 100_000`)
- CWE-78: All subprocess calls use argument lists (no shell invocation)
- CWE-22: Path validation via `resolve()` within `project_root`

### Data Classes

#### `AggregatedSignal`
A single aggregated improvement signal.

**Attributes**:
- `source: str` - Origin (session, benchmark, ci, github)
- `signal_type: str` - Classification (hook_failure, benchmark_weakness, bypass_detected, tool_failure, agent_crash, github_issue)
- `description: str` - Human-readable description (secrets scrubbed)
- `frequency: int` - How many times observed in the window
- `severity: float` - Normalized severity score (0.0–1.0)
- `raw_data: Dict[str, Any]` - Original data for traceability
- `timestamp: str` - ISO 8601 timestamp of most recent occurrence

#### `SourceHealth`
Health status of a signal source.

**Attributes**:
- `source: str` - Source name
- `status: str` - "ok", "error", or "empty"
- `signal_count: int` - Number of signals collected
- `error_message: str` - Error details when status is "error"

#### `AggregatedReport`
Complete report with ranked signals and per-source health.

**Attributes**:
- `signals: List[AggregatedSignal]` - Ranked signals (highest priority first)
- `source_health: List[SourceHealth]` - Health per source
- `window_start: str` - ISO 8601 start of analysis window
- `window_end: str` - ISO 8601 end of analysis window
- `generated_at: str` - ISO 8601 report generation timestamp
- `top_n: int` - Maximum signals included

### Public API

#### `aggregate()`

Main entry point. Collects from all 4 sources, ranks, and persists.

```python
aggregate(
    project_root: Path,
    *,
    window_days: int = 7,
    top_n: int = 10,
    repo: str = "akaszubski/autonomous-dev",
) -> AggregatedReport
```

**Parameters**:
- `project_root` - Root directory of the project
- `window_days` - Days to look back (default: 7)
- `top_n` - Maximum signals in report (default: 10)
- `repo` - GitHub repository for issue collection

**Returns**: `AggregatedReport` with ranked signals and source health

**Side effect**: Appends report to `.claude/logs/aggregated_reports.jsonl`

#### `collect_session_signals(logs_dir, window_days)`
Reads `.claude/logs/activity/*.jsonl`, extracts tool failures (`success=false`), hook errors, and agent crashes. Groups by `(signal_type, description)` for frequency counting.

#### `collect_benchmark_signals(history_path, window_days)`
Uses `BenchmarkHistory` to load entries, filters by time window, converts per-category accuracy deficits below `BENCHMARK_ACCURACY_THRESHOLD` (0.70) into signals.

#### `collect_ci_signals(logs_dir, patterns_path, window_days)`
Reads session logs and cross-references against `known_bypass_patterns.json` to detect model intent bypasses. Deduplicates by `(pattern_id, date)`.

#### `collect_github_signals(repo)`
Runs `gh issue list --label auto-improvement` via subprocess. Gracefully falls back if `gh` is unavailable or times out (30s).

#### `compute_priority(signal) -> float`
Priority formula: `SEVERITY_WEIGHTS[signal_type] * severity * log(1 + frequency)`

**Type weights** (higher = more urgent):
- bypass_detected: 1.5
- hook_failure: 1.4
- benchmark_weakness: 1.3
- step_skipping: 1.2
- github_issue: 1.0

### Usage Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from runtime_data_aggregator import aggregate

report = aggregate(
    Path("/path/to/project"),
    window_days=7,
    top_n=10,
)

for signal in report.signals:
    print(f"[{signal.source}] {signal.signal_type}: {signal.description}")
    print(f"  severity={signal.severity:.2f}, frequency={signal.frequency}")

for health in report.source_health:
    print(f"{health.source}: {health.status} ({health.signal_count} signals)")
```

**Testing**:

- `tests/genai/test_acceptance_runtime_data_aggregator.py` — acceptance tests

## 176+1. runtime_verification_classifier.py (373 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #564)

**Purpose**: Classify changed files into runtime verification targets so the reviewer agent can decide which opt-in runtime checks to run after completing static code review.

**GitHub Issue**: #564 — Runtime Verification Classifier

### Public API

```python
from runtime_verification_classifier import classify_runtime_targets

plan = classify_runtime_targets(["src/routes/api.py", "public/index.html"])
print(plan.has_targets)  # True
print(plan.summary)      # "Frontend: 1 target(s), API: 1 target(s)"
```

### Data Classes

- **`FrontendTarget`** — A frontend file verifiable via Playwright or browser. Fields: `file_path`, `framework` (html|react|vue|svelte), `suggested_checks`.
- **`ApiTarget`** — An API route/endpoint verifiable via curl. Fields: `file_path`, `framework` (fastapi|flask|express|generic), `endpoints`, `methods`.
- **`CliTarget`** — A CLI tool or script verifiable via subprocess. Fields: `file_path`, `tool_name`, `suggested_commands`.
- **`RuntimeVerificationPlan`** — Aggregated plan. Fields: `has_targets` (bool), `frontend` (List[FrontendTarget]), `api` (List[ApiTarget]), `cli` (List[CliTarget]), `summary` (str).

### Detection Rules

- **Frontend**: matches `.html`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte` extensions; excludes test files.
- **API**: matches `routes/`, `api/`, `endpoints/`, `views/` path patterns and common server filenames (`app.py`, `main.py`, `server.py`, `server.js`, `server.ts`); guesses framework (fastapi, flask, express) from path; excludes test files.
- **CLI**: matches files with no extension or explicit CLI naming patterns; excludes test files.

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_runtime_verification_classifier.py` — unit tests
- `tests/genai/test_acceptance_runtime_verification.py` — acceptance tests

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-03-28) - Initial release for runtime data aggregation (Issue #579, Component 1)

## 176+2. python_write_detector.py (404 lines, v1.1.0 - Issues #589, #698)

**Purpose**: Detect file-write operations in Python code snippets (e.g., `python3 -c` arguments, heredoc bodies) using AST-based extraction with regex fallback. Used by `unified_pre_tool.py` to close the Bash-wrapped write bypass gap — wrapping a `Path.write_text()` call in a Bash command would otherwise evade the infrastructure-file write guard.

**GitHub Issues**: #589 — Python3 Path.write_text() bypass detection hardening; #698 — os.rename/os.replace/Path.rename/Path.replace inline bypass detection

### Public API

```python
from python_write_detector import extract_write_targets, has_suspicious_exec, SUSPICIOUS_EXEC_SENTINEL

# Primary entry point: AST first, regex fallback
targets = extract_write_targets('from pathlib import Path as P; P("hooks/foo.py").write_text("x")')
# => ["hooks/foo.py"]

# Quick check for dynamic eval/exec
is_suspicious = has_suspicious_exec("exec(user_input)")
# => True
```

### Functions

- **`extract_write_targets(code: str) -> List[str]`** — Main entry point. Tries AST parsing first; falls back to regex on `SyntaxError`, `RecursionError`, `MemoryError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`. Returns list of file paths that would be written to. May include `SUSPICIOUS_EXEC_SENTINEL` if `eval()`/`exec()` with dynamic (non-constant) arguments is detected. Truncates input to `MAX_SNIPPET_LENGTH = 10_000` characters before parsing. Pre-processes literal `\n`/`\t` escape sequences (common in shell `-c` strings) before AST parsing.
- **`extract_write_targets_ast(code: str) -> List[str]`** — AST-only extraction. Raises `SyntaxError` on invalid Python. Detects: `Path(...).write_text/write_bytes` with any import alias; `open(path, 'w'/'a'/'wb'/'ab')`; `shutil.copy/copy2/move/copyfile` destination arguments; `os.rename(src, dst)`/`os.replace(src, dst)` with aliased `os` module and `from os import rename` style; `Path(...).rename(dst)`/`Path(...).replace(dst)` (destination is first argument); `eval()`/`exec()` with non-constant first argument.
- **`extract_write_targets_regex(code: str) -> List[str]`** — Regex fallback. Less accurate but handles syntactically invalid snippets. Same detection categories as AST variant, except `import os as o; o.rename(...)` and `from os import rename` alias tracking require the AST path.
- **`has_suspicious_exec(code: str) -> bool`** — Quick check for `eval()`/`exec()` with dynamic arguments.

### Constants

- **`SUSPICIOUS_EXEC_SENTINEL`** (`"__SUSPICIOUS_EXEC__"`) — Sentinel string appended to results when dynamic `eval()`/`exec()` is detected. Callers check `t != SUSPICIOUS_EXEC_SENTINEL` when iterating targets to separate real paths from this flag.
- **`MAX_SNIPPET_LENGTH`** (`10_000`) — Maximum input length; longer snippets are truncated before parsing to prevent DoS.

### Detection Coverage

| Pattern | AST | Regex |
|---------|-----|-------|
| `Path("f").write_text(...)` | Yes | Yes |
| `from pathlib import Path as P; P("f").write_text(...)` | Yes (alias tracking) | Yes |
| `open("f", "w")` / `open("f", "a")` | Yes | Yes |
| `shutil.copy(src, "dst")` / `copy2` / `move` / `copyfile` | Yes | Yes |
| `import shutil as s; s.copy(src, "dst")` | Yes (alias tracking) | No |
| `os.rename(src, "dst")` / `os.replace(src, "dst")` | Yes | Yes |
| `import os as o; o.rename(src, "dst")` | Yes (alias tracking) | Yes |
| `from os import rename; rename(src, "dst")` | Yes (alias tracking) | No |
| `Path("src").rename("dst")` / `Path("src").replace("dst")` | Yes | Yes |
| `eval(var)` / `exec(var)` | Yes | Yes |
| `exec("literal string")` | Not flagged (safe) | Not flagged |

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_python_write_detector.py` — unit tests

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-03-29) - Initial release for AST-based Python write detection in Bash bypass hardening (Issue #589); v1.1.0 (2026-04-07) - Added detection of `os.rename`/`os.replace`/`Path.rename`/`Path.replace` inline bypass patterns (Issue #698)

## 176+3. agent_ordering_gate.py (324 lines, v1.2.0 - Issues #625, #629, #632, #669, #697)

**Purpose**: Pure-logic gate for pipeline agent ordering decisions. No I/O, no side effects. Receives state as input, returns gate decisions. Used by `unified_pre_tool.py` to enforce agent invocation order at hook level, preventing out-of-order Agent/Task tool calls during pipeline execution.

**GitHub Issues**: #625, #629, #632 — Hook-level enforcement for pipeline agent ordering; #669 — Defense-in-depth for parallel mode: `launched_agents` parameter + `warning` field on `GateResult`; #697 — Mode-aware prerequisite filtering: `pipeline_mode` parameter skips prerequisites for agents not in the current mode's required set

### Public API

```python
from agent_ordering_gate import check_ordering_prerequisites, check_minimum_agent_count, check_batch_agent_completeness, GateResult

# Check if prerequisites are met before invoking a target agent (full mode, default)
result = check_ordering_prerequisites("implementer", {"planner"})
# result.passed == True (prerequisites met)

# Fix mode: planner is not part of the pipeline, so its prerequisite is skipped
result = check_ordering_prerequisites("implementer", set(), pipeline_mode="fix")
# result.passed == True (planner prerequisite skipped — not in fix pipeline)

# Parallel mode: pass launched_agents to distinguish "running concurrently" from "skipped"
result = check_ordering_prerequisites(
    "security-auditor", {"implementer"}, validation_mode="parallel",
    launched_agents={"implementer", "reviewer"}
)
# result.passed == True, result.warning set (reviewer launched but not completed)
```

### Functions

- **`check_ordering_prerequisites(target_agent, completed_agents, *, validation_mode="sequential", launched_agents=None, pipeline_mode="full") -> GateResult`** — Check if ordering prerequisites are met for a target agent. In sequential mode, all `SEQUENTIAL_REQUIRED` pairs are enforced. In parallel mode, the `reviewer → security-auditor` constraint is relaxed — but only if the prerequisite has been launched; if it has not been launched at all the check still blocks (Issue #669). Prerequisites for agents not in the current `pipeline_mode`'s required set are skipped — e.g., in `--fix` mode, the `planner → implementer` prerequisite is skipped because planner is not part of the fix pipeline (Issue #697). When the prerequisite is launched but not yet completed, a `warning` is attached to the result for observability. Unknown agents always pass through.
- **`get_required_agents(mode="full", *, research_skipped=False) -> Set[str]`** — Return the set of required agents for a given pipeline mode ("full", "light", "fix", or "tdd-first").
- **`check_minimum_agent_count(completed_agents, *, required_agents) -> GateResult`** — Check that all required agents have completed (e.g., before git operations).
- **`check_batch_agent_completeness(completed_agents, issue_number, *, mode="default") -> GateResult`** — Check if all required agents have completed for a batch issue. Supports `"default"` (full pipeline), `"light"`, and `"fix"` modes.

### Dataclasses

- **`GateResult`** — `passed: bool`, `reason: str`, `missing_agents: list[str]`, `warning: Optional[str]` — `warning` is set in parallel mode when a prerequisite has been launched but not yet completed (Issue #669)

### Constants

- **`FULL_PIPELINE_AGENTS`** — Set of agents required for a complete pipeline run (researcher-local, researcher, planner, implementer, reviewer, security-auditor, doc-master)
- **`LIGHT_PIPELINE_AGENTS`** — Reduced set for `--light` mode (planner, implementer, doc-master)
- **`FIX_PIPELINE_AGENTS`** — Reduced set for `--fix` mode (implementer, reviewer, doc-master)
- **`STEP_ORDER`** — Dict mapping agent name to step number (imported from `pipeline_intent_validator` with inline fallback)
- **`SEQUENTIAL_REQUIRED`** — List of `(prerequisite, target)` pairs always enforced in sequential mode
- **`MODE_DEPENDENT_PAIRS`** — Pairs relaxed in parallel mode (`reviewer → security-auditor`), subject to `launched_agents` check

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_agent_ordering_gate.py` — unit tests (8 regression tests added in Issue #697 via `TestPipelineModeFiltering` class; 14 regression tests added in Issue #669)

**Version History**:
- v1.2.0 (2026-04-07) - Mode-aware prerequisite filtering: `pipeline_mode` parameter skips prerequisites for agents not in the current mode's required set; `_get_pipeline_mode_from_state()` helper in `unified_pre_tool.py` reads mode from pipeline state file (Issue #697)
- v1.1.0 (2026-04-07) - Defense-in-depth: `launched_agents` parameter blocks parallel mode bypass when prerequisite not launched; `GateResult.warning` field for observability; fail-open logging in `unified_pre_tool.py` (Issue #669)
- v1.0.0 (2026-03-30) - Initial release for hook-level pipeline ordering enforcement (Issues #625, #629, #632)

## 176+4. pipeline_completion_state.py (289 lines, v1.1.0 - Issues #625, #629, #632, #686)

**Purpose**: Shared state for agent ordering enforcement. Manages a per-session JSON state file that tracks which pipeline agents have completed and which have been launched. Written by `unified_session_tracker.py` (SubagentStop for completions) and `unified_pre_tool.py` (PreToolUse for launches), read by `unified_pre_tool.py` to enforce ordering.

**State file path**: `/tmp/pipeline_agent_completions_{sha256(session_id)[:8]}.json` (auto-expires after 2 hours)

**GitHub Issues**: #625, #629, #632 — Hook-level enforcement for pipeline agent ordering; #686 — Agent launch tracking for parallel-mode defense-in-depth

### Public API

```python
from pipeline_completion_state import (
    record_agent_completion, get_completed_agents,
    record_agent_launch, get_launched_agents,
    set_validation_mode, get_validation_mode, clear_session,
)

# Record that an agent completed (called by unified_session_tracker.py)
record_agent_completion(session_id="abc123", agent_type="planner", issue_number=42, success=True)

# Record that an agent was launched (called by unified_pre_tool.py in PreToolUse)
record_agent_launch(session_id="abc123", agent_type="reviewer", issue_number=42)

# Read completed agents (called by unified_pre_tool.py)
completed = get_completed_agents(session_id="abc123", issue_number=42)
# => {"planner"}

# Read launched agents (used by parallel-mode defense-in-depth guard)
launched = get_launched_agents(session_id="abc123", issue_number=42)
# => {"reviewer"}
```

### Functions

- **`record_agent_completion(session_id, agent_type, *, issue_number=0, success=True) -> None`** — Record that an agent has completed for a given session and issue. Called by `unified_session_tracker.py` on SubagentStop.
- **`get_completed_agents(session_id, *, issue_number=0) -> set[str]`** — Get the set of agents that have completed successfully for a session/issue. Returns empty set on any read error (fail-open).
- **`record_agent_launch(session_id, agent_type, *, issue_number=0) -> None`** — Record that an agent has been launched (started) for a given session and issue. Called by `unified_pre_tool.py` in PreToolUse BEFORE the agent runs. Used by the parallel-mode defense-in-depth guard to distinguish "running concurrently" from "skipped entirely". (Issue #686)
- **`get_launched_agents(session_id, *, issue_number=0) -> set[str]`** — Get the set of agents that have been launched for a session/issue. Returns empty set on any read error. (Issue #686)
- **`record_prompt_baseline(agent_type, issue_number, word_count, *, state_dir=None) -> None`** — Record baseline prompt word count for an agent. Persists to `.claude/logs/prompt_baselines.json`. Hook uses `issue_number=0` as a sentinel when seeding from the prompt integrity gate (Issue #723).
- **`get_prompt_baseline(agent_type, *, state_dir=None) -> Optional[int]`** — Get the baseline word count (from the first recorded issue) for an agent. Returns `None` if no baseline exists (fail-open).
- **`set_validation_mode(session_id, mode) -> None`** — Set ordering enforcement mode (`"sequential"` or `"parallel"`).
- **`get_validation_mode(session_id) -> str`** — Get ordering enforcement mode (default: `"sequential"`).
- **`clear_session(session_id) -> None`** — Remove the state file for a session (called at pipeline cleanup).

### State File Format

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "created_at": "2026-03-30T12:00:00+00:00",
  "validation_mode": "sequential",
  "completions": {
    "42": {"planner": true, "test-master": true}
  },
  "launches": {
    "42": {"reviewer": true, "security-auditor": true}
  },
  "prompt_baselines": {}
}
```

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_pipeline_completion_state.py` — unit tests

**Version History**:
- v1.1.0 (2026-04-07) - Added `record_agent_launch()` and `get_launched_agents()` for parallel-mode defense-in-depth; `unified_pre_tool.py` now passes `launched_agents` to ordering gate (Issue #686)
- v1.0.0 (2026-03-30) - Initial release for pipeline ordering state management (Issues #625, #629, #632)

## 176+5. tier_registry.py (226 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #677)

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for Diamond Model test tier classification. Maps test directories to tier IDs (T0–T3), lifecycle policies, pytest markers, and max duration constraints. Replaces the hardcoded `DIRECTORY_MARKERS` dict that previously lived in `tests/conftest.py`.

**GitHub Issue**: #677 — Test tiering classification — Diamond Model layer metadata

### Public API

```python
from tier_registry import get_tier_for_path, get_all_tiers, get_tier_distribution, is_prunable, build_directory_markers

# Match a test path to its tier
tier = get_tier_for_path("tests/unit/lib/test_foo.py")

### Key Data Structure

`TierInfo` (frozen dataclass): `tier_id` (T0–T3), `name`, `directory_pattern`, `lifecycle` (permanent|stable|semi-stable|ephemeral), `markers` (list), `max_duration` (optional string).

`TIER_REGISTRY` (list of TierInfo): Ordered most-specific to least-specific for pattern matching. First match wins.

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Lifecycle | Directories |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| T0 | permanent | `tests/genai/`, `tests/regression/smoke/` |
| T1 | stable | `tests/e2e/`, `tests/integration/` |
| T2 | semi-stable | `tests/regression/regression/`, `tests/regression/extended/`, `tests/property/` |
| T3 | ephemeral | `tests/regression/progression/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/hooks/`, `tests/security/` |

### Functions

- **`get_tier_for_path(test_path: str) -> Optional[TierInfo]`** — Match a test file path against the registry. Normalizes path separators. Returns first matching TierInfo or None.
- **`get_all_tiers() -> List[TierInfo]`** — Return all tier definitions sorted by tier_id then name.
- **`get_tier_distribution(test_paths: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]`** — Count paths per tier_id; unmatched paths counted under `"unknown"`.
- **`is_prunable(test_path: str) -> bool`** — True for ephemeral (T3, always prunable) and semi-stable (T2, prunable after 90d unused). False for T0, T1, or unknown.
- **`build_directory_markers() -> Dict[str, List[str]]`** — Convert registry to conftest.py-compatible `{pattern_suffix: [markers]}` dict.

### Integration

- **`tests/conftest.py`**: Imports `build_directory_markers()` at startup to populate `DIRECTORY_MARKERS`. Falls back to hardcoded dict if import fails (e.g., running outside project).
- **`tests/conftest.py` terminal summary**: Uses `get_tier_for_path()` in `pytest_terminal_summary` hook to print tier distribution after each test run.
- **`step5_quality_gate.py`**: Imports `get_tier_distribution()` to include tier breakdown in the STEP 5 quality gate report.

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_tier_registry.py` — unit tests for all public functions

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-04-06) - Initial release for Diamond Model tier classification (Issue #677)

## 176+6. test_pruning_analyzer.py (818 lines, v1.0.0 - Issue #674)

**Purpose**: AST-based test hygiene analyzer that detects orphaned, stale, and redundant tests. Invoked by `/sweep --tests` to produce an informational pruning report. Never auto-deletes files.

**Problem**: Test suites accumulate dead weight — imports that reference deleted modules, tests for archived code, zero-assertion stubs, and stale regression markers. Manual identification is tedious and error-prone.

**Solution**: `TestPruningAnalyzer` walks all `test_*.py` / `*_test.py` files using Python's `ast` module and runs 5 detectors in sequence, reporting each finding with severity, prunable flag (from `tier_registry`), and a suggested action.

### Detection Categories

| Category | Enum Value | Severity | Description |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Dead Imports | `DEAD_IMPORT` | HIGH | Import from a module not found in source |
| Archived References | `ARCHIVED_REF` | MEDIUM | Import referencing an `archived/` path |
| Zero-Assertion Tests | `ZERO_ASSERTION` | HIGH/MEDIUM | Test function with no meaningful assertions |
| Duplicate Coverage | `DUPLICATE_COVERAGE` | LOW | Test whose entire set of non-framework call signatures is a strict subset of another test's signatures (per-test subset granularity, not per-call matching; test framework utilities such as `Mock`, `patch`, `assert_called_*` are excluded from signatures) |
| Stale Regressions | `STALE_REGRESSION` | LOW | Test name matches `TestIssueNNN` / `test_issue_NNN` pattern |

### Public API

```python
from test_pruning_analyzer import TestPruningAnalyzer, PruningReport, PruningFinding
from pathlib import Path

analyzer = TestPruningAnalyzer(Path("."))
report = analyzer.analyze()
print(report.format_table())
```

**`TestPruningAnalyzer(project_root: Path)`**
- `analyze() -> PruningReport` — runs all detectors and returns consolidated report

**`PruningReport`**
- `findings: List[PruningFinding]` — all findings across scanned files
- `scan_duration_ms: float` — total scan time
- `files_scanned: int` — number of test files analyzed
- `format_table() -> str` — renders findings as a markdown table sorted by severity

**`PruningFinding`**
- `file_path: str`, `line: int`, `category: PruningCategory`, `severity: Severity`
- `description: str`, `suggestion: str`, `prunable: bool`

### Prunable Flag

`prunable` is determined by `tier_registry.is_prunable(path)`. T2/T3 tier test files are prunable; T0/T1 are not. This prevents accidentally flagging smoke tests and critical regression tests as safe to delete.

### Integration

- Used by `plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/sweep.md` (`/sweep --tests` mode)
- Depends on `tier_registry.get_tier_for_path()` and `tier_registry.is_prunable()`
- Skips `__pycache__`, `.git`, `.worktrees`, `archived`, `node_modules`, `.tox`, `.venv`, `venv` directories

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_test_pruning_analyzer.py` — unit tests for all 5 detectors

## 176+7. test_issue_tracer.py (v1.0.0 - Issue #675)

**Purpose**: Map test files to GitHub issues and flag tracing gaps (untested issues, orphaned pairs, untraced test files).

**Problem**: As the codebase grows, it becomes difficult to verify that every GitHub issue has a corresponding test and that tests reference current (not closed) issues.

**Solution**: Static scan of `tests/` for 7 issue-reference patterns, cross-referenced against live GitHub issues via `gh` CLI, producing a structured `TracingReport` with three finding categories.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/test_issue_tracer.py`

**Key Features**:
- 7 reference patterns: `TestIssueNNN` class names, `test_issue_NNN` function names, docstring `#NNN`, comment `# Issue: #NNN`, `GH-NNN` shorthand, `@pytest.mark.issue(NNN)`, and keyword phrases (`Regression #NNN`, `Closes #NNN`, `Fixes #NNN`)
- False-positive filtering: excludes hex colors, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# pragma`, and `#0`–`#2`
- Deduplication: one `IssueReference` per `(file_path, issue_number)` pair
- GitHub cross-reference via `gh issue list --state all --limit 500`; caches results for 300s
- Non-blocking: `check_issue_has_test()` returns `True` on any exception to never block the pipeline
- Three finding categories: `UNTESTED_ISSUE` (open issue, no test ref), `ORPHANED_PAIR` (test refs closed issue), `UNTRACED_TEST` (test file with zero issue refs)
- All findings are severity `info` — advisory only

### Public API

**`TestIssueTracer(project_root: Path)`**
- `scan_test_references() -> List[IssueReference]` — scan `tests/` for all issue references
- `fetch_github_issues(*, cache_ttl_seconds=300) -> Dict[int, dict]` — fetch issues via `gh` CLI with caching
- `analyze() -> TracingReport` — full cross-reference analysis
- `check_issue_has_test(issue_number: int) -> bool` — quick single-issue check

**`TracingReport`**
- `findings: List[TracingFinding]`, `references: List[IssueReference]`
- `scan_duration_ms: float`, `issues_scanned: int`, `tests_scanned: int`
- `format_table() -> str` — renders markdown summary table

**`IssueReference`**
- `file_path: str`, `line: int`, `issue_number: int`, `reference_type: str`

**`TracingFinding`**
- `category: TracingCategory`, `severity: str`, `description: str`
- `issue_number: Optional[int]`, `file_path: Optional[str]`

### Integration

- Used by `plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/audit.md` (`/audit --test-tracing` flag)
- Used by `plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/implement.md` STEP 13 non-blocking warning
- Gracefully degrades when `gh` CLI is unavailable or unauthenticated (returns empty issue dict)

### Testing

- `tests/unit/test_test_issue_tracer.py` — unit tests for scanning, cross-reference, and false-positive filtering

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-04-06) - Initial release for `/sweep --tests` test pruning analysis (Issue #674)

## 176+8. autoresearch_engine.py (v1.0.0 - Issue #654)

**Purpose**: Autonomous experiment loop engine for the `/autoresearch` command. Provides target validation, metric execution, experiment history tracking, and stall detection for the hypothesis-test-measure loop.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/autoresearch_engine.py`

**Key Features**:
- Target whitelist enforcement: only `agents/*.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md` paths are allowed as optimization targets, preventing uncontrolled modifications to arbitrary files
- Metric script execution: runs a Python script and parses `METRIC: <float>` from stdout/stderr; last matching line wins; raises `ValueError` when no line matches
- Experiment history: append-only JSONL log (`.claude/logs/autoresearch/<target-name>.jsonl`) tracking hypothesis, before/after metrics, outcome, and delta per iteration; tolerates corrupt lines on read
- Stall detection: `check_stall()` halts the loop when N consecutive iterations fail to improve the metric (default N=3)
- Git integration: `create_experiment_branch()` creates `autoresearch/<target-name>-<timestamp>` branches; `commit_improvement()` stages and commits improvements; `revert_target()` restores the last committed state on failure
- `dry_run` mode: skips all git operations (no branch, no commits) for safe local experimentation

### Public API

**`ExperimentConfig`** (dataclass)
- `target` (Path): File to optimize
- `metric_script` (Path): Benchmark script that emits `METRIC: <float>`
- `iterations` (int): Max iterations (default 20)
- `min_improvement` (float): Min delta to count as improvement (default 0.01)
- `dry_run` (bool): Skip git operations (default False)
- `experiment_branch` (str): Override branch name (auto-generated if empty)
- `max_stall` (int): Max consecutive failures before halt (default 3)

**Functions**
- `validate_target(target, *, repo_root) -> Tuple[bool, str]` — check target is within repo and matches whitelist
- `validate_metric(metric_script) -> Tuple[bool, str]` — check metric script exists and is a file
- `run_metric(metric_script, *, timeout=300) -> Tuple[float, str]` — execute benchmark script, return (metric_value, raw_output)
- `create_experiment_branch(target_name) -> str` — create and checkout `autoresearch/<name>-<timestamp>` branch
- `revert_target(target) -> None` — `git checkout --` to discard uncommitted changes
- `commit_improvement(target, *, message) -> str` — stage, commit, return SHA
- `check_stall(history, *, max_consecutive=3) -> bool` — True when consecutive failures >= max_consecutive

**`ExperimentHistory`** (class)
- `__init__(path: Path)` — JSONL history file path
- `append(*, hypothesis, metric_before, metric_after, outcome)` — append experiment result
- `load_all() -> List[Dict]` — all valid entries, oldest first; corrupt lines skipped silently
- `load_recent(n=10) -> List[Dict]` — up to N most recent entries, newest first
- `consecutive_failures() -> int` — count of consecutive non-improved outcomes from end
- `summary() -> Dict` — total/improved/reverted/error counts and best/worst deltas

### Integration

- Used exclusively by `plugins/autonomous-dev/commands/autoresearch.md` (`/autoresearch` command)
- Allowed targets: `agents/*.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md` (whitelist enforced by `validate_target()`)

### Testing

- Tests added as part of Issue #654 implementation

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-04-07) - Initial release for `/autoresearch` autonomous experiment loop (Issue #654)

## 176+9. covers_index.py (v1.0.0 - Issue #713)

**Purpose**: Pre-computed source-path to doc-file mapping for doc-master optimization. Parses `covers:` YAML frontmatter from all `docs/*.md` files once (at index build time) and stores the result as `docs/covers_index.json`, eliminating the per-invocation 23-file scan that previously ran on every doc-master call.

**Location**: `plugins/autonomous-dev/lib/covers_index.py`

**Key Features**:
- Frontmatter extraction: reads YAML between `---` delimiters, returns the `covers:` list as strings; gracefully handles missing frontmatter, YAML parse errors, and encoding errors
- Three matching modes in `get_affected_docs()`: exact match, prefix match (index key ends with `/`), and glob match (index key contains `*`, matched with `fnmatch`)
- Metadata preservation: `save_covers_index()` writes `_generated` (ISO timestamp) and `_doc_count` alongside the index; `load_covers_index()` strips metadata keys (prefix `_`) on read so callers receive a clean dict
- Deterministic output: doc lists within each index key are sorted; index keys are sorted when serialized
- CLI companion: `scripts/build_covers_index.py` regenerates `docs/covers_index.json` and prints a summary line (`N source paths, M doc mappings`)

### Public API

**Functions**:
- `build_covers_index(docs_dir: Path) -> dict[str, list[str]]` — scan all `*.md` files in docs_dir, return source-path → doc-file mapping
- `get_affected_docs(changed_files: list[str], index: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[str]` — return deduplicated sorted list of doc files affected by the given changed paths
- `save_covers_index(index: dict[str, list[str]], output_path: Path) -> None` — write index + metadata as formatted JSON
- `load_covers_index(index_path: Path) -> dict[str, list[str]]` — load and return index without metadata keys; raises `FileNotFoundError` or `json.JSONDecodeError` on failure

### Integration

- Consumed by `doc-master` agent (`agents/doc-master.md`) to replace the per-invocation bash frontmatter scan
- Pre-built by `scripts/build_covers_index.py`; generated output stored at `docs/covers_index.json`
- Dependency: `pyyaml` (already required by several other lib modules)

### Testing

- `tests/unit/lib/test_covers_index.py` — 24 tests covering build, query (exact/prefix/glob), save/load round-trip, metadata stripping, and error handling

**Version History**: v1.0.0 (2026-04-08) - Initial release for doc-master covers index optimization (Issue #713)
