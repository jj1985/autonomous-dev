# Skills Reference

19 active skill packages at `plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/`. Skills are progressively injected into agent context — loaded only when the task matches the skill's `TRIGGER when:` conditions, so they don't bloat every prompt.

**Design principle**: One domain per skill. Each `SKILL.md` declares when it loads (TRIGGER) and when it doesn't (DO NOT TRIGGER) so the model gets the right knowledge at the right time without over-inclusion.

## How Skills Load

Skills aren't auto-included in every agent prompt. The matching logic lives in the coordinator and agent prompts — when an agent references a skill in its `skills:` frontmatter, it's asserting "load this when you handle tasks that match the TRIGGER conditions."

Example from `agents/implementer.md`:
```yaml
---
name: implementer
skills: [python-standards, testing-guide, error-handling, security-patterns]
---
```

The implementer agent's prompt references those four skills when tasks involve Python, tests, error paths, or security-sensitive code — not all four every time.

## Skill Effectiveness

Each skill is measurable via `/skill-eval`:

```bash
/skill-eval                       # Full eval — all 19 skills
/skill-eval --quick               # Fast mode (fewer prompts per skill)
/skill-eval --skill python-standards   # One skill only
/skill-eval --update              # Update baseline after confirmed improvement
```

See [EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md) for the measurement surface and closed-loop self-improvement workflow that runs benchmarks before/after every skill edit.

Skill Effectiveness Gate (STEP 11.5 of `/implement`): When any `skills/*/SKILL.md` file is modified, the pipeline runs skill-eval on the changed skills and blocks if the delta drops more than 0.10. Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` env var — skipped with warning if unset.

## Authoring a New Skill

Each skill lives in its own directory at `plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. Required frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <slug>                   # matches directory name
description: "<one sentence> Use when ..."
trigger: "TRIGGER when: ..."   # matching keywords
do_not_trigger: "DO NOT TRIGGER when: ..."
version: "1.0.0"
---
```

Design principles:
- **One domain per skill**. Don't bundle "Python standards + testing + Git" into one file.
- **TRIGGER and DO NOT TRIGGER lines are required** — they prevent over-inclusion that bloats context.
- **Keep the body short** — skills are read whole into context when they match. 100-200 lines is typical.
- **Agents must reference skills by slug** in their frontmatter, or the skill won't load even when triggered.

Validation: `python3 scripts/validate_structure.py` and `pytest tests/unit/test_documentation_congruence.py` check skill layout and frontmatter.

## Archived Skills

`plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/archived/` holds retired skills no longer loaded into any agent. They remain for historical reference but do not fire. See `docs/HARNESS-EVOLUTION.md` for retirement rationale.
