## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/sweep` command: codebase hygiene — detect dead tests, doc drift, code rot** — New command orchestrates `SweepAnalyzer` (wrapping `TechDebtDetector`, `HybridManifestValidator`, `OrphanFileCleaner`) to surface hygiene issues across three categories: dead/orphaned tests (`--tests`), documentation drift (`--docs`), and code rot (`--code`). Running `/sweep` with no flags executes all three. Adding `--fix` applies automated remediation after detection; without it the command is a dry-run (detect only, no changes). Addresses the gap where hygiene issues accumulated silently between `/improve` sessions.

- **Plan mode exit auto-routing to /implement or /create-issue** (Issue #358) — `plan_mode_exit_detector.py` PostToolUse hook detects when the model calls `ExitPlanMode` and writes a marker at `.claude/plan_mode_exit.json` with a UTC timestamp and session ID. `unified_prompt_validator.py` checks this marker on every subsequent `UserPromptSubmit` event and blocks raw edits, requiring the user's next action to be `/implement "description"` or `/create-issue "description"`. Questions (prompts ending with `?`) are allowed through without blocking. The marker auto-expires after 30 minutes and is deleted when consumed. This closes the gap where approving a plan in plan mode and then directly editing files bypassed all pipeline quality gates — testing, security review, and documentation sync. Registered in all settings templates; both hooks always exit 0.

- **TaskCompleted hook handler for pipeline observability** (Issue #463) — `task_completed_handler.py` registers the `TaskCompleted` lifecycle event and logs task completion data (task_id, task_subject, task_description, teammate_name, team_name) to the daily activity JSONL at `.claude/logs/activity/{date}.jsonl`. The handler reads JSON from stdin, applies the same project-root detection logic as other hooks, and always exits 0. This is a preparation handler: TaskCompleted does not yet fire in the autonomous-dev Agent-tool pipeline, but registering the hook now means infrastructure is ready when the event becomes available. Registered in all 6 settings templates. Lifecycle constraint: TaskCompleted is non-blocking (like Stop and PostToolUse); hooks on this event must always exit 0.

- **PreCompact/PostCompact hooks for batch state preservation across context compaction** (Issue #464) — `pre_compact_batch_saver.sh` runs before compaction and writes `.claude/compaction_recovery.json` containing the full batch state (batch_id, current_index, total_features, feature list, RALPH checkpoint data). `post_compact_enricher.sh` runs after compaction and enriches the marker with the compaction summary from stdin. `unified_prompt_validator.py` now calls `_check_compaction_recovery()` at the start of every UserPromptSubmit event — if the recovery marker exists, it re-injects the batch context (current feature, remaining features, completed/failed counts, compaction summary) into stderr output so the model resumes where it left off. Both hooks are registered in all settings templates. All three components always exit 0 and never block.

- **ADR-001 and Stop-verify-test-coverage PoC: agent hook exploration** (Issue #467) — `docs/ADR-001-agent-hooks.md` documents the decision to use `type:agent` hooks for advisory-only quality checks on non-blocking events (Stop, PostToolUse). Agent hooks spawn a read-only subagent (up to 50 tool turns, 60-second timeout) that can perform semantic checks impossible in Python — e.g., verifying test files actually exercise their source counterparts. The ADR codifies five rules: always return `{"decision": "approve"}`, use only Read/Grep/Glob tools, register only on Stop/PostToolUse, never on PreCommit/PreToolUse/UserPromptSubmit, and remain opt-in by default. `plugins/autonomous-dev/hooks/Stop-verify-test-coverage.md` is the proof-of-concept hook that checks test coverage for modified files after Stop. 8 unit tests in `tests/unit/hooks/test_agent_hook_poc.py` validate the hook file exists, references only read-only tools, and never contains blocking decisions or enforcement language.

- **`/implement --fix` mode: targeted bug-fix pipeline** (Issues #431, #362, #363) — New `implement-fix.md` command routes `--fix` flag to a streamlined pipeline optimised for bug fixes rather than feature development. Skips acceptance-test authoring and goes directly to targeted reproduction → fix → regression test cycle. `batch_agent_verifier.py` library (#362/#363) provides reusable agent verification logic shared by the fix pipeline and batch coordinator to confirm required agents ran per issue. Eliminates manual per-issue agent audits in batch mode.

- **Infrastructure file protection hook: blocks direct Write/Edit to pipeline files outside `/implement`** (Issue #483) — `unified_pre_tool.py` now intercepts `Write` and `Edit` tool calls targeting `agents/*.md`, `commands/*.md`, `hooks/*.py`, `lib/*.py`, and `skills/*/SKILL.md`. If the `/implement` pipeline is not active (no active pipeline marker), the hook blocks the operation with a clear message directing the user to run `/implement` instead. This converts the CLAUDE.md "NEVER direct-edit" rule from advisory text the model can ignore into a hard enforcement gate that fires on every matching tool call. Operations on user-facing docs (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/*.md`), config files (`.json`/`.yaml`), and all other paths are unaffected.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md reduced from 112 to 75 lines by removing hook-enforced and inferable rules** (Issue #465) — Removed content that is either enforced automatically by hooks (no need to remind the model) or inferable from context (e.g., command table footnotes, redundant "why" explanations already captured in `docs/WORKFLOW-DISCIPLINE.md`). Component counts (agents, skills, hooks, libraries) moved out of CLAUDE.md into `docs/ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md` as the single source of truth, preventing counts from going stale in two places simultaneously. The leaner CLAUDE.md loads faster into context and surfaces the rules that actually need model attention — critical commands, direct-edit boundaries, and session discipline.

- **RFC 2119 enforcement language standardized across all agent prompts** (Issue #466) — Added RFC 8174 boilerplate ("The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL'...") to all 13 active agents and 3 command files, replacing informal advisory language with normative terminology. Enforcement statements now use MUST/MUST NOT for blocking requirements and SHOULD/MAY for recommendations, making the distinction between hard gates and guidance unambiguous to the model. Standardized 5 core files (`implementer.md`, `reviewer.md`, `researcher.md`, `test-master.md`, `security-auditor.md`) that had the highest density of informal "should/always/never" phrasing. 7 validation tests in `tests/unit/agents/test_rfc2119_language.py` verify boilerplate presence, correct normative keyword usage, and absence of informal enforcement substitutes across all agent files.

- **pytest.ini: expanded coverage scope and enabled minimum threshold** (Issue #462) — `--cov` now includes `lib/` alongside the previously covered directories, closing a gap where library code was excluded from coverage reports. `--cov-fail-under=4` is uncommented, establishing a failing threshold that ratchets upward toward the 80% target stated in PROJECT.md. Previously, library code could regress to zero coverage without any CI signal.

### Fixed

- **continuous-improvement-analyst: added "Known False Positives" section to suppress noisy false issue filings** (Issue #482) — Four recurring false positives were causing the analyst to file spurious `auto-improvement` issues on every batch run: (1) STEP 3.5 skipping when GenAI test infra is absent (expected behavior), (2) SubagentStop `success=false`/`duration_ms: 0` fields which are a known hook instrumentation bug affecting all sessions, (3) short agent output word counts from structured-verdict agents (PASS/FAIL responses are legitimately brief), and (4) test-master absence in default acceptance-first mode (test-master only runs under `--tdd-first`). The analyst now has explicit "DO NOT file issues for these" guidance so signal-to-noise stays high and real pipeline regressions remain visible.

- **Test suite: removed test files that imported from archived hooks, extracted reusable CLI exception handling tests** (Issue #472) — Five test files were importing from hooks that had been archived (`health_check.py`, `validate_commands.py`, `unified_doc_auto_fix.py`), causing import errors on every test run. Deleted the five stale files and extracted the still-valid CLI exception-handling coverage into `tests/test_cli_exception_handling.py`. `auto_fix_docs.py` had a silent fallback that invoked the archived `unified_doc_auto_fix` module; the fallback was removed so failures surface immediately. `TestHealthCheckIntegration` was removed from `test_install_integration.py` as its assertions depended on the archived health-check hook's output format. The test suite now imports only from active hooks.

- **reviewer agent: explicit read-only enforcement prevents unreviewed post-review edits** (Issue #461) — Added HARD GATE "Read-Only Enforcement" section to `reviewer.md` that explicitly forbids the reviewer from using Write or Edit tools on any file. When the reviewer found issues and fixed them directly, those changes bypassed the STEP 5 test gate (no full test suite re-run after reviewer edits) and introduced unreviewed modifications. The reviewer now reports all findings with `file_path:line_number` references and sets verdict to REQUEST_CHANGES, with the coordinator relaying findings to the implementer for fixing. Updated docs/AGENTS.md reviewer entry to document the read-only role.

- **docs/AGENTS.md: removed stale advisor agent entry from Core Workflow Agents** (Issue #468) — The `advisor` agent was archived (Issue #331) and its logic inlined into the `/advise` command, which no longer delegates to a subagent. The stale block listing advisor as an active Core Workflow Agent with an `advisor-triggers` skill has been removed. The archived section already correctly listed advisor.

- **SubagentStop hook: stdin-first input, duration tracking, transcript validation, and universal template registration** — `unified_session_tracker.py` now reads agent context from stdin JSON (as Claude Code provides it) instead of environment variables, resolving missing-data failures when env vars were not forwarded. The hook computes `duration_ms` by diffing `AgentTracker.started_at` against the current time, populating the field that `pipeline_intent_validator` uses for ghost invocation detection. `agent_transcript_path` is validated to be within `~/.claude` before use, preventing path traversal. All 6 settings templates now consistently register the SubagentStop hook so session tracking and pipeline state are written regardless of which template a project uses. `pipeline_intent_validator.py` updated to parse the new JSONL entries emitted by the tracker, ensuring ghost detection (`duration_ms` + `result_word_count`) works end-to-end. 25 new unit tests cover stdin parsing, duration computation, transcript path validation, JSONL output format, and settings template hook registration.

- **Agent registry synchronized: 15 active, 14 archived — no ghost or orphan entries** (Issue #411) — Resolved AGENT_CONFIGS drift where 5 ghost registrations (AGENT_CONFIGS entries with no matching agent file) and 6 orphan agents (files with no registry entry) caused Claude to bypass quality pipelines by invoking individual agents instead of full command pipelines. Removed ghosts (alignment-validator, pr-description-generator, project-progress-tracker, data-quality-validator, distributed-training-coordinator — all archived) and registered orphans (continuous-improvement-analyst, issue-creator, quality-validator, sync-validator, test-coverage-auditor, researcher-local). Agent count corrected to 15 active (14 archived). `/health-check` now validates registry consistency on every run.

- **settings_generator.py: removed redundant glob patterns** (Issue #365) — Duplicate glob entries in generated settings files caused hook dispatcher to fire more than once per tool call for some tool patterns. Deduplicated pattern lists so each hook lifecycle event registers exactly once, reducing unnecessary dispatch overhead.

- **worktree_manager.py: CWD safety check before worktree operations** (Issue #410) — Added guard that validates the current working directory is not inside a worktree being discarded or merged before executing the operation. Previously, running `/worktree --discard` from within the target worktree directory left the shell in a deleted path, causing subsequent commands to fail with cryptic "no such file or directory" errors.

- **Settings templates: all now register all 4 hook lifecycle layers** — Five settings templates (default, granular-bash, permission-batching, global_settings_template, and one more) were missing `UserPromptSubmit` and/or `Stop` hooks. All templates now consistently register `UserPromptSubmit` (prompt routing), `PreToolUse` (permission validation), `PostToolUse` (activity logging), and `Stop` (quality gate). Previously some templates silently dropped prompt validation and session end logging.

- **session_activity_logger: UserPromptSubmit handler + session date pinning** — The logger now captures user prompts (preview + length) as `UserPromptSubmit` entries, making session logs complete from prompt to tool calls to response. Added `_get_session_date()` which pins each session to its start date using a small sidecar file — preventing midnight crossings from splitting a long session across two log files and breaking per-session analysis.

- **unified_pre_tool: git bypass detection** — Added `_detect_git_bypass()` to block dangerous git flag combinations before they execute: `--no-verify` on commit/push/merge, `--force`/`-f` on push, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`/`-fd`, and the `-n` shorthand. Handles pipes by only parsing the first command segment. Previously these bypasses could silently skip pre-commit hooks and force-push to protected branches.

- **pipeline_intent_validator: ghost invocation detection** — Added `detect_ghost_invocations()` which flags agent calls completing in under 10 seconds with fewer than 50 result words. Also added `duration_ms` field to `PipelineEvent` (populated from JSONL log entries) so timing data flows through to all validation checks. Ghost invocations indicate an agent was invoked but did no real work — a silent failure mode where the pipeline appears complete but key steps were skipped.

- **continuous-improvement-analyst: explicit ghost invocation criteria** — Batch mode check for fast agents now includes the exact ghost detection rule (duration <10s AND result_word_count <50 → [GHOST]) matching the library implementation. Full mode now explicitly lists ghost invocations in the bypass check list with a reference to `detect_ghost_invocations()`. Aligns the agent's written criteria with the library's actual detection thresholds.

- **Continuous-improvement-analyst agent rewrite: two-mode automation QA** (Issue #394)
  - Refactored from 295 lines to ~100 lines with clearer responsibility separation
  - **Batch mode** (3-5 tool calls, <30s): Fast per-issue quality check during batch processing
    - Verifies required agents ran in context provided (no log file parsing)
    - Flags suspicious agents completing in <10s with zero file reads
    - Reports findings from context without filing GitHub issues
  - **Full mode** (10-15 tool calls): Comprehensive post-batch or standalone analysis
    - Parses session logs with `pipeline_intent_validator` library
    - Detects HARD GATE violations, missing agents, hook layer failures
    - Files deduped GitHub issues for actionable findings (severity >= warning)
  - Mission unchanged: "Is autonomous-dev's automation working correctly?"
  - Improved signal-to-noise: Batch mode avoids log parsing overhead; Full mode reuses existing validation library
  - Updated docs/AGENTS.md with two-mode architecture description

- **Batch pipeline fidelity: per-issue dedicated pipeline tracking** (Issue #386)
  - Prevents coordinator from grouping multiple batch issues into a single pipeline pass
  - Coordinator MUST run full pipeline per issue (not per batch) in `/implement --batch-issues` mode
  - Required agents: 7 (acceptance-first mode) or 8 (TDD-first mode)
  - Added detection pattern `batch_group_pipeline` to known_bypass_patterns.json with CRITICAL severity
  - Detection indicators: Agent count below required threshold per issue, multiple test files in same time window, combined issue processing
  - Updated implement-batch.md STEP B3 with per-issue pipeline state tracking and mandatory agent count verification
  - Added `per_issue: true` note to expected_end_states in known_bypass_patterns.json clarifying agents apply per issue
  - Test coverage: 10 regression tests validating pattern detection, severity levels, and issue isolation requirements
  - Prevents batch mode regression where Issue #1-2 get full pipeline, Issue #3+ get shortened pipeline (Issue #363)

- **Agent Teams evaluation: keep worktrees for batch processing** (Issue #390)
  - Evaluated Claude Code's Agent Teams feature as potential replacement for worktree-based batch processing
  - Decision: **Keep worktrees** as primary mechanism due to 3 critical blockers
  - Blocker 1: Agent Teams has no file-level locking (shared filesystem, last write wins) — can't handle concurrent writes to overlapping files
  - Blocker 2: No session resumption — interrupts lose teammates, no equivalent to `/implement --resume` worktree recovery
  - Blocker 3: One team per session — can't run parallel batches; worktrees allow multiple concurrent sessions
  - Identified appropriate Agent Teams use cases: research phases, code review, architecture analysis (read-only operations)
  - Comparison matrix: Worktrees score 6/8, Agent Teams score 2/8 on reliability metrics
  - Full evaluation with decision rationale in docs/evaluations/issue_390_agent_teams_evaluation.md

- **Adopt /reload-plugins command in documentation** (Issue #391)
  - Updated 8 documentation files with context-aware reload guidance
  - CLAUDE.md: Added `/reload-plugins` to installation instructions and `/sync` command docs
  - plugins/autonomous-dev/README.md: Added guidance distinguishing `/reload-plugins` from full restart scenarios
  - plugins/autonomous-dev/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Added troubleshooting section explaining when to use `/reload-plugins` vs. full restart
  - Root README.md: Updated installation and setup sections
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Updated development workflow guidance
  - docs/WORKFLOW-DISCIPLINE.md: Added reload context to agent coordination section
  - docs/GIT-AUTOMATION.md: Updated git+plugin workflow
  - install.sh: Added post-install instructions mentioning `/reload-plugins`

- **HTTP Hooks evaluation: keep command hooks as primary mechanism** (Issue #392)
  - Evaluated Claude Code's HTTP hooks feature (v2.1.69+) as potential replacement for command-based hooks
  - Decision: **Keep command hooks as primary** due to enforcement and filesystem requirements
  - Analysis shows command hooks win 7 of 10 comparison dimensions (blocking, latency, filesystem access, failure mode)
  - HTTP hooks identified as suitable supplementary mechanism for notifications, CI/CD triggers, remote audit logging, and dashboard updates
  - Security analysis: HTTP hooks lack HMAC verification and fail-open on timeout, making them unsuitable for blocking enforcement policies
  - Full evaluation with decision tree, comparison matrix, and security best practices in docs/evaluations/issue_392_http_hooks_evaluation.md

- **Per-Issue Agent Count HARD GATE in batch mode** (Issue #363)
  - Prevents progressive shortcutting where later issues in batch run fewer agents than earlier issues
  - After each issue completes, coordinator MUST verify all required agents ran:
    - **Acceptance-first mode** (default): 7 agents (researcher-local, researcher, planner, implementer, reviewer, security-auditor, doc-master)
    - **TDD-first mode**: 8 agents (add test-master)
  - continuous-improvement-analyst runs post-issue as QA agent to detect bypass patterns; NOT part of core pipeline count
  - Display enumerated ✓/✗ status for each required agent before advancing to next issue
  - BLOCKED if any required agent missing — must complete missing agents first
  - Added to implement-batch.md STEP B3 point 4
  - Added `batch_progressive_shortcutting` to known_bypass_patterns.json
  - Prevents Issue #362 regression: Issues 1-2 full pipeline, Issues 3+ reduced agents

- **StateManager.__repr__() method** (Issue #220 enhancement)
  - Added `__repr__()` to StateManager ABC for developer-friendly string representation
  - Returns format: `ClassName(state_file=/path)` if state_file exists, otherwise `ClassName()`
  - Updated module docstring and LIBRARIES.md documentation

- **Coverage Gap Assessment HARD GATE in test-master** (Issue #?)
  - Mandatory assessment runs before writing ANY tests to prevent over-testing or under-testing changes
  - Classification table maps change type → required test types (unit, integration, GenAI)
  - GenAI infrastructure detection: checks if `tests/genai/conftest.py` exists
  - Gap summary output before test writing (FORBIDDEN to skip this step)
  - Prevents 6 common testing anti-patterns: hardcoded counts, missing integration tests, incorrect GenAI coverage, GenAI-only for auth changes, skipping all test types
  - Test validation: `tests/genai/test_coverage_gap_gate_quality.py`, `tests/unit/agents/test_test_master_coverage_gap_gate.py`
  - Enhanced implement.md STEP 4 to pass file list and GenAI infra status to test-master
  - Enables right-sized testing: only required test types per change category

- **Testing Pipeline Redesign: GenAI-Native Testing** (Issue #364)
  - Replaced TDD RED phase with specification-driven testing approach
  - Added property-based testing via `hypothesis` as 4th test pattern in test-master and testing-guide
  - **Zero-skip HARD GATE**: `@pytest.mark.skip` is no longer an acceptable resolution for failing tests
  - Only 2 options for failing tests: Fix it or Adjust expectations (skip removed)
  - Added `skip_accumulation` bypass pattern to known_bypass_patterns.json
  - Prevents skip accumulation across sessions where LLM agents never revisit skipped tests

- **Skip accumulation prevention: cross-session baseline enforcement** (Issue #364, #332) — Skip count is now tracked in `.claude/local/coverage_baseline.json` across sessions via `coverage_baseline.check_skip_regression()`. The STEP 5 HARD GATE in `implement.md` BLOCKS if skip count exceeds the stored baseline — even by one test. This closes the gap where the zero-skip rule was declared in text but had no persistent state preventing drift across restarts. Implementer agent enforces the same gate with explicit FORBIDDEN list including `pytest.skip()` inside test bodies and `xfail` markers.

- **Coverage regression gate: persistent baseline with 0.5% tolerance** (Issue #332) — `coverage_baseline.py` (new library) stores coverage percentage, skip count, and total test count after each successful `/implement` run. STEP 5 now runs `pytest --cov` after all tests pass and compares against the baseline. Coverage drops greater than 0.5% BLOCK progression to STEP 6. Baseline auto-updates on success, so coverage improvements are captured immediately. Eliminates silent regression where new code lands without test coverage.

- **Regression test requirement for bug fixes** (Issue #357) — Implementer agent now has a mandatory HARD GATE: when fixing a bug (invoked via `--fix` or when fixing a known bug), at least one new regression test must be added that reproduces the bug. The test must fail without the fix and pass with it. FORBIDDEN: fixing a bug without a regression test, adding a test that passes regardless of the fix. Exception: if the bug was already caught by an existing failing test, that test is the regression test — document which test covers it. Closes the gap where bug fixes landed clean but the same bug could silently reappear.

- **Pipeline agent quality audit: HARD GATEs and model upgrades** (Issue #366)
  - researcher.md: upgraded model from haiku to sonnet for better judgment on ambiguous queries, added structured JSON output format, added HARD GATE requiring at least one WebSearch call (FORBIDDEN to skip web research)
  - reviewer.md: added HARD GATE requiring pytest run before APPROVE decision, FORBIDDEN to approve with failing or erroring tests, must cite file:line for every finding
  - doc-master.md: upgraded model from haiku to sonnet, added semantic README update guidance, added GenAI congruence validation HARD GATE (must run and pass before declaring docs complete)
  - security-auditor.md: added systematic OWASP Top 10 checklist covering all 10 categories (A01-A10), FORBIDDEN to issue PASS without checking every category
  - planner.md: added FORBIDDEN to proceed with Out of Scope features (must escalate and stop), added required acceptance criteria output block per planned feature
  - researcher-local.md: added HARD GATE on empty search results, must search at least 3 distinct terms before concluding no relevant code exists
  - Impact: All 6 affected pipeline agents now enforce explicit quality gates preventing weak outputs

- **Conversational Feature Request Detection in Prompt Validator** (Issue #368)
  - Expanded prompt validator to catch conversational phrasing (e.g., "how do we develop an app", "let's build a dashboard", "can we create a migration script")
  - Extended noun list in /implement route: app, application, tool, project, product, ui, frontend, backend, page, screen, view, dashboard, wizard, dialog, widget, library, framework, database, schema, migration, script
  - Added new pattern for conversational openers: "let's", "we should", "how do we", "can we", "I want to", "I need to", "we need to", "we could" followed by action verb
  - Prevents conversational feature requests from being missed by prompt routing
  - Test coverage: 2 new test classes in test_command_routing.py (12 parametrized tests for conversational phrasing + expanded nouns)

- **Repo-Aware CI Analyst Calibration** (Issue #369)
  - Continuous-improvement-analyst now calibrates expectations based on registered hooks in consumer repos
  - When analyzing a consumer repo (not autonomous-dev itself), only flags missing hook layers that have corresponding hooks in the repo's settings.json
  - Updated analyst to read target repo's settings.json and extract registered hooks for context
  - Updated /improve command to pass registered hooks context to the analyst
  - Enables accurate quality analysis for repos with non-standard hook configurations (e.g., enterprise repos with limited hook set)
  - Impact: Consumer repos no longer get false positive [HOOK-GAP] findings for intentionally-disabled hooks

- **Intent-level pipeline validation added to continuous-improvement-analyst** (Issue #367)
  - New library: `pipeline_intent_validator.py` — validates pipeline step ordering, hard gate enforcement, context passing, and parallelization via JSONL session logs
  - Continuous-improvement-analyst quality check #8: Runs pipeline intent validator against session logs to detect coordinator-level violations:
    - Step ordering violations (e.g., implementer before planner) → `[INTENT-VIOLATION]` CRITICAL
    - Hard gate ordering bypass (STEP 6 agents before STEP 5 pytest passes) → `[BYPASS]` CRITICAL
    - Context dropping (agent prompt < 20% of prior result word count) → `[INTENT-VIOLATION]` WARNING
    - Parallelization violations (sequential steps launched together) → `[INTENT-VIOLATION]` CRITICAL
    - Parallelization suggestions (parallel steps unnecessarily serialized) → `[OPTIMIZE]` INFO
  - Added 5 new patterns to `known_bypass_patterns.json`:
    - `sequential_step_parallelized`: test-master and implementer launched within 5 seconds
    - `parallel_step_serialized`: researchers or STEP 6 agents >30s apart

- **Pipeline state machine for /implement command** (Issue #402)
  - New library: `pipeline_state.py` — Pipeline state tracker with gate enforcement (stdlib only, zero dependencies)
  - Tracks 13-step pipeline progression: ALIGNMENT, RESEARCH_CACHE, RESEARCH, PLAN, ACCEPTANCE_TESTS, TDD_TESTS, IMPLEMENT, HOOK_CHECK, VALIDATE, VERIFY, REPORT, CONGRUENCE, CI_ANALYSIS
  - Enforces gate conditions (HARD GATE violations block advancement; CHECKPOINT violations show warnings)
  - Persists state to JSON for resumable pipelines and session analysis
  - Methods: create_pipeline(), advance(), complete_step(), skip_step(), can_advance(), get_trace(), load_pipeline(), save_pipeline()
  - Step validation: Prevents out-of-order execution, enforces required status before advancement, tracks all transitions
  - Enables continuous-improvement-analyst to validate coordinator state machine adherence
  - Test coverage: 27 tests covering creation, serialization, step advancement, gate enforcement, trace/reporting, cleanup, and edge cases
    - `context_dropping`: Agent prompt word count < 20% of prior result (coordinator summarization)
    - `hard_gate_ordering_bypass`: STEP 6 agents before STEP 5 pytest passes
    - `reviewer_blocking_ignored`: Reviewer BLOCKING issues not fixed before proceeding
  - Session logger now captures prompt_word_count and result_word_count for quantitative context analysis
  - Updated continuous-improvement-analyst.md with complete quality check #8 specification
  - Impact: Coordinator-level intent violations now detectable in quality audits (previously only structural checks)

- **Skill Evaluation Framework: LLM-as-Judge for Skills** (Issue #389)
  - New library: `skill_evaluator.py` (295 lines) — Evaluates skill quality, guides accuracy, and completeness via LLM-as-judge
  - `BenchmarkStore` class: Tracks baseline scores in JSON for regression detection (save/load/get/update baseline methods)
  - `SkillEvaluator` class: Evaluates skills with 4 methods:
    - `evaluate_skill()` — Single-prompt skill evaluation with score and timestamp
    - `evaluate_skill_batch()` — Multi-prompt batch evaluation (returns list of scored results)
    - `compare_variants()` — A/B test two skill variants with paired comparison (minimum 10 prompts for statistical validity, returns winner/mean scores/margin)
    - `check_regression()` — Detect skill quality degradation vs baseline (configurable threshold, default 10%)
  - GenAI tests: 20+ tests in `tests/genai/skills/`:
    - `test_skill_evals.py` (10 tests) — Skill evaluation across 4 domains: code standards, documentation, security, architecture
    - `test_skill_ab_testing.py` (10 tests) — A/B testing framework and statistical methodology validation
  - Unit tests: 17 tests in `tests/unit/lib/test_skill_evaluator.py`
    - BenchmarkStore load/save/persistence, JSON serialization, cache behavior
    - Baseline tracking with timestamps, default structure generation
  - Documentation: Added to `docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md` (Layer 5: LLM-as-Judge section) and `docs/LIBRARIES.md` (entry #60)
  - Workflow: Enable nightly skill quality regression detection in CI, variant comparison before shipping skill updates
  - Performance: ~30 seconds per skill (single evaluation), ~2 minutes for 10-prompt batch (with caching)

- **Skill Description Optimization** (Issue #388)
  - Updated all 16 active SKILL.md description fields to follow structured pattern
  - New format: Concrete capabilities → "Use when" triggers → "TRIGGER when" keywords → "DO NOT TRIGGER when" exclusions
  - Example: `"PEP 8, Black formatting, type hints, docstrings. Use when writing/reviewing Python code. TRIGGER when: python, formatting, type hints, PEP 8, black. DO NOT TRIGGER when: non-Python files, markdown, shell scripts."`
  - Benefits: LLM skill selector can now make precise routing decisions vs generic skill descriptions
  - Impact: Improved skill activation accuracy, reduced context bloat from inappropriate skill loading
  - Coverage: api-design, api-integration-patterns, architecture-patterns, code-review, documentation-guide, git-github, library-design-patterns, observability, python-standards, quality-scoring, research-patterns, scientific-validation, security-patterns, skill-integration, state-management-patterns, testing-guide

  - Updated `continuous-improvement-analyst.md` with guidance on recognizing Agent/Task/Skill tool entries in session logs
  - Test coverage: 9 new unit tests validating Agent/Skill/Task tool capture, word counting, and backward compatibility
  - Impact: Pipeline intent validation now detects all 9 required agents regardless of Claude Code version (pre/post Task→Agent rename)
  - Fixes: Coordinator-level violations invisible when Task tool renamed to Agent (Issue #380), CI analysis gaps due to skipped Agent invocations (Issue #408, #411)

### Changed

- **Refactored `/implement` from 384-line inline to 143-line thin coordinator** (Issue #444)
  - Delegates specialist work to agents via Agent tool instead of running inline steps
  - All HARD GATEs preserved: test gate, hook registration, doc congruence, STEP 9 mandatory
  - 63% context reduction in main conversation window per pipeline run
  - Added Agent to allowed-tools (was: Task); added two new FORBIDDEN items to coordinator list
  - New tests: `tests/unit/test_implement_command_structure.py`, `tests/genai/test_acceptance_implement_thin_coordinator.py`

- **Batch worktree cleanup CWD protection** (Issue #410)
  - Fixed critical bug where deleting a worktree while shell CWD is inside it bricks the shell session
  - `cleanup_worktree()` now checks if current working directory is inside the worktree before deletion
  - If CWD is inside the worktree, automatically changes directory to the main repository first using `os.chdir()`
  - Returns 3-tuple `(success, error, safe_cwd)` where `safe_cwd` indicates the main repo path (None if CWD was already outside)
  - Updated implement-batch.md STEP B4 with explicit "cd to main repo BEFORE cleanup" instruction
  - Added FORBIDDEN rule in STEP B4: "Do NOT delete a worktree directory while your shell CWD is inside it. ALWAYS `cd` to the main repository FIRST."
  - Unit test: `test_cleanup_from_inside_worktree_changes_cwd()` validates CWD is moved to valid directory after cleanup
  - Acceptance tests: 4 GenAI-judged criteria validate instruction clarity, FORBIDDEN rule presence, implementation correctness, and post-cleanup shell functionality
  - Impact: Batch processing is now safe to run with worktrees, even if coordinator CWD is inside the worktree during finalization
  - Prevents Issue #410 regression: shell becoming unusable after batch cleanup

- **Make acceptance-first testing the default `/implement` mode** (Issue #404)
  - Changed default testing paradigm from TDD-first (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) to acceptance-first (write spec, validate acceptance, implement)
  - Added `--tdd-first` flag for users who prefer legacy TDD-first pipeline
  - Acceptance-first now runs by default: STEP 3.5 (Acceptance tests) → STEP 4 (Implementation) → STEP 5 (TDD validation only if needed)
  - TDD-first now requires explicit flag: `/implement "desc" --tdd-first` to revert to traditional test-first workflow
  - Updated `/implement` command documentation (implement.md: STEP 0, STEP 3.5, STEP 4, STEP 5, STEP 7, Technical Details)
  - Updated test-master agent (test-master.md: description, mission note, step responsibilities)
  - Updated implementer agent (implementer.md: step 4b, acceptance test expectations)
  - Updated PROJECT.md constraints to reflect new default testing mode
  - Updated docs/TESTING-STRATEGY.md with migration guide and new acceptance-first workflow patterns
  - Impact: All `/implement` modes (single, quick, batch) default to acceptance-first; TDD users can opt-in with flag
  - Rationale: Acceptance-first prevents over-testing and aligns with specification-driven development philosophy

- **STEP 9 Continuous Improvement Analysis — Mandatory Enforcement (Issue #625)**
  - Upgraded STEP 9 from advisory to HARD GATE with explicit FORBIDDEN list
  - Moved pipeline cleanup (`rm -f /tmp/implement_pipeline_state.json`) from STEP 8 to STEP 9 post-analyst launch
  - FORBIDDEN behaviors: skipping STEP 9, cleaning state before analyst launch, inlining analysis (must invoke agent)
  - Impact: All `/implement` modes now guarantee continuous-improvement-analyst execution (full pipeline, quick, batch)
  - Analyzer mission evolved: tests automation itself (PROJECT.md + CLAUDE.md ground truth), not just user work
  - Analyzer now evaluates: hook execution (4 layers), pipeline completeness, HARD GATE enforcement, command routing, error handling, known/novel bypass detection
  - Updated implement.md COORDINATOR FORBIDDEN LIST (added 2 items), STEP 5 note, STEP 9 section
  - Updated QUICK MODE to enforce STEP 9 + cleanup pattern (previously had no structured improvement check)
  - Updated continuous-improvement-analyst.md mission and 7 quality checks (hook completeness, pipeline completeness, HARD GATE enforcement, command routing, error handling, bypass patterns, novel detection)
  - Rationale: Automation quality requires continuous verification; advisor-only messaging gets ignored under context pressure

- **Reduce auto-activate token overhead for training skills** (Issue #335)
  - Changed 4 training skills from auto_activate: true to false:
    - training-operations (Run management, monitoring, crash recovery)
    - training-methods (8 stable training methods reference guide)
    - dpo-rlvr-generation (DPO preference pairs and RLVR verification)
    - anti-hallucination-training (Calibration and refusal training)
  - Rationale: These are specialized knowledge skills activated only on specific keywords, not general auto-activation
  - Impact: Auto-activate skill count reduced from 19 to 15 (skills still available, just not loaded upfront)
  - Reduces context bloat from loading unused training knowledge during non-training workflows
  - Training workflows explicitly use keywords to activate skills as needed
  - Updated plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/training-operations/SKILL.md
  - Updated plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/training-methods/SKILL.md
  - Updated plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/dpo-rlvr-generation/SKILL.md
  - Updated plugins/autonomous-dev/skills/anti-hallucination-training/SKILL.md

### Fixed

- **Pre-existing test failure cleanup (Issue #403)**
  - Removed 34 obsolete tests from Phase 4 and Phase 5 pipeline stub files that were never implemented
  - Deleted test_pipeline_phase4_model_optimization.py (15 tests for unimplemented model optimization)
  - Deleted test_pipeline_phase5_prompt_simplification.py (19 tests for unimplemented prompt simplification)
  - Created test_agent_quality_regression.py with 5 new regression tests extracted from deleted files
  - Fixed pipeline_controller.py: Added proper context manager semantics and signal handlers
  - Created pipeline_state.py library: State machine tracker for pipeline progression
  - Net result: Eliminated 29 pre-existing test failures, added 5 regression tests covering core quality gates
  - Impact: Test suite now passes cleanly, improving developer experience and CI/CD reliability

- **Hook registration pipeline gap fix (Issue #348)**
  - Fixed hook orphan registration bug where newly created hooks weren't registered in settings templates
  - Root cause: hooks added to disk but settings registration missed, causing hooks to never execute
  - Examples of potential breakage: session_activity_logger.py created but never wired to PostToolUse
  - Solution: Added comprehensive regression test suite (test_issue_348_hook_settings_sync.py) with 7 test classes:
    - TestActiveHooksRegistered: Verifies no orphan hooks on disk without settings registration
    - TestSettingsReferencesResolve: Ensures settings never reference non-existent or archived hooks
    - TestManifestSync: Validates install_manifest.json stays in sync with actual hook files
    - TestHookSyntaxValid: Verifies all hooks have valid Python syntax
    - TestArchivedNotReferenced: Prevents archived hooks from being imported by active code
    - TestSessionActivityLoggerWiring: Specific validation for critical hook wiring (Issue #348 original)
    - TestCriticalHookEventPlacement: Validates critical hooks in correct lifecycle events
  - Enforcement: Added HARD GATE section to implementer.md requiring hook registration in 3 places (settings, manifest, tests)
  - Added STEP 5.5 to implement.md command for hook registration verification
  - Archived batch_permission_approver.py (functionality merged into unified_pre_tool.py Layer 3)
  - Updated docs/HOOKS.md to remove stale batch_permission_approver.py reference
  - Result: 17 active hooks (down from 18), 62 archived hooks
  - Prevents future #336-#344 style breakage where archived hooks remain referenced

- **Worktree context safety fixes (Issues #313-316)**
  - Fixed 28+ worktree context breaking patterns across 10 files
  - Issue #313: Path resolution bugs - Replaced hardcoded relative paths with get_project_root() (6 files)
    - brownfield_retrofit.py: 2 relative path refs → dynamic get_project_root()
    - orphan_file_cleaner.py: Hardcoded plugins/ → get_project_root() / "plugins"
    - settings_generator.py: Relative plugins/ → get_project_root() / "plugins"
    - test_session_state_manager.py: Hardcoded .claude/ → get_project_root() / ".claude"
    - test_agent_tracker.py: Hardcoded paths → get_project_root() / "docs/sessions"
    - Fixes CWE-22 (Path Traversal) by validating all paths relative to project root
  - Issue #314: Environment propagation to subprocesses - Added env parameter to subprocess calls (2 files)
    - qa_self_healer.py: Added env=os.environ to all subprocess.run() calls
    - test_runner.py: Propagated environment variables to pytest subprocess
    - Fixes CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path) by ensuring consistent environment
  - Issue #315: Global CWD pollution - Replaced os.chdir() with cwd= parameter (1 file)
    - ralph_loop_manager.py: Changed os.chdir(worktree_dir) to subprocess cwd=worktree_dir
    - Prevents global state pollution from worktree operations
  - Issue #316: Validated .gitignore configuration
    - Verified .worktrees/ directory properly excluded from version control
    - Batch processing worktrees remain isolated and disposable
  - All libraries now use absolute paths via get_project_root() for worktree safety
  - All subprocess calls propagate environment variables for consistent behavior
  - No global CWD pollution from worktree operations
  - Test results: 22/33 tests passing (67% pass rate, 11 failures under investigation)
